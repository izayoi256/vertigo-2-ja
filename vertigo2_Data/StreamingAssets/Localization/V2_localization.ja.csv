And I see not its legacy of hate
A future bright and peaceful may yet grow

It hangs now in the air, tranquil at last
But I fear nonetheless for its abduction

The red light glinting off of blood once more
Why they would fight this fight I do not know
If only they knew how it was before

To learn the truth from I, who know it best.
With patience everlasting I shall wait
Beyond the void’s reach, in the wild west.

Think back to his words on the open sea.
Defy the deadly fate that He has planned,
The vortex shall deliver you to me.

brian_assembly_00_talk_caption_01,"I haven’t been helping you out of pure generosity. Before you arrived, I was contacted by a friend of mine."
brian_assembly_00_talk_caption_02,"Nani’s motivations are, I must admit, a bit of a mystery to me,"
brian_assembly_00_talk_caption_03,but he gave me some hot intel and only asked that in return I deliver you to the reactor core to return home.
brian_assembly_00_talk_caption_04,"I know what you’ll ask, and no, I don’t know why Nani cares about you. He refuses to tell me. "
brian_assembly_00_talk_caption_05," I’m a man of my word though, and I’ve been doing everything in my power to deliver you to the core."
brian_assembly_00_talk_caption_06,Just try to stay alive a bit longer and we’ll all be happy.  
brian_assembly_00_talk_caption_07,"I would love to stay here and help in person, but I’d just draw more security to you. "
brian_assembly_00_talk_caption_08,Best thing I can do is head back to HQ and guide you remotely.

brian_assembly_02_lock_caption_00,Good news. This is a standard quantum encrypted lock.
brian_assembly_02_lock_caption_01,"Unhackable, but the rest of the keys should be nearby."
brian_assembly_02_lock_caption_02,Head into Assembly and poke around. I’ll reconnect when I reach Brian Industries.
brian_assembly_02_lock_caption_03,"God, I wish Therus hadn’t just completely disappeared. Could use an assistant right now. "
brian_assembly_03_core_caption_00,I see you got the core unsealed. Took you long enough.  
brian_assembly_03_core_caption_01,"Sorry, I mean well done. "
brian_assembly_03_core_caption_02,You’re getting close now. The core is just one floor away.
brian_assembly_03_core_caption_03,You’ve made it much further through the quantum reactor than most aliens do.
brian_assembly_03_core_caption_04,Let’s keep this lucky streak going just for a bit longer.
Therus_BonVoyage_00_goodmorning_caption_00,Good morning!
Therus_BonVoyage_00_goodmorning_caption_01,Brian's waiting for you. Come along now.
Therus_BonVoyage_01_sorry_caption_00,I'm so sorry about yesterday.
Therus_BonVoyage_01_sorry_caption_01,Apparently the reactor cycle reminded Brian he wanted to test your fighting skills.
Therus_BonVoyage_01_sorry_caption_02,"The whole [quot]I need my internet back[quot] bit was all made up, obviously."
Therus_BonVoyage_02_goodnews_caption_00,The good news is you did great!
Therus_BonVoyage_02_goodnews_caption_01,Good thing too. You're going to have to face much worse deeper in the reactor.
Therus_BonVoyage_03_trust_caption_00,Here we are.
Therus_BonVoyage_03_trust_caption_01,"Before we go in there, I want you to know, you probably shouldn't trust-"
Brian_BonVoyage_00_trust_caption_00,Shouldn't trust what?
Therus_BonVoyage_04_handymen_caption_00,"Uh, handymen. Shouldn't trust handymen."
Brian_BonVoyage_01_racist_caption_00,Goddamn right. 
Brian_BonVoyage_01_racist_caption_01,"Wait, is that racist? I’m not racist, I swear."
Brian_BonVoyage_01_racist_caption_02,"Ah, get in here. Therus, go research something!"
Therus_BonVoyage_05_ok_caption_00,Ok bossman.
Brian_BonVoyage_02_options_caption_00,Okay. I’m gonna give it to you straight: you don’t belong here.
Brian_BonVoyage_02_options_caption_01,There’s no place for you on our Earth.
Brian_BonVoyage_02_options_caption_02,"Sure, you look like the humans of this universe -- I could smuggle you out of the reactor, get you to a city, forge some documents..."
Brian_BonVoyage_02_options_caption_03,but your DNA is still going to give you away as an alien from a divergent universe.
Brian_BonVoyage_02_options_caption_04,"With that out of the question, you’ve got two other options."
Brian_BonVoyage_03_blackhole_caption_00,Option one - you live the rest of your sad little life here in the reactor.
Brian_BonVoyage_03_blackhole_caption_01,I don’t recommend this.
Brian_BonVoyage_03_blackhole_caption_02,"I’m here for the time being because of some legal troubles up on Earth, but it’s pretty rough down here."
Brian_BonVoyage_03_blackhole_caption_03,Option two - and this is the good one - I send you back to your home universe.
Brian_BonVoyage_03_blackhole_caption_04,"See, all the science until now has pointed at inter-universal travel being uncontrollable,"
Brian_BonVoyage_03_blackhole_caption_05,something that can only be caused by truly random quantum events.
Brian_BonVoyage_03_blackhole_caption_06,"However, I have recently learned that there is another way. "
Brian_BonVoyage_03_blackhole_caption_07,"Using a black hole, jumping between dimensions at will is possible in the right circumstances.  "
Brian_BonVoyage_04_plan_caption_00,I’ve been working on the math while you’ve been healing up. 
Brian_BonVoyage_04_plan_caption_01,"With the correct firmware tweaks to the core’s wavefront inhibitors, I think it’ll work. I think I can get you home."
Brian_BonVoyage_04_plan_caption_02,"I know this must be overwhelming for you, but believe me when I say all I want is for you to reach the reactor core safely."
Brian_BonVoyage_04_plan_caption_03,"Just my inherent kindness of heart, I suppose. "
Therus_BonVoyage_06_situation_caption_00,"Brian, we've got a situation."
Brian_BonVoyage_05_situation_caption_00,"Not a great time, Therus. But, uh, what kind of situation? "
Therus_BonVoyage_07_camera_caption_00,Grab the live feed of camera B-84
Brian_BonVoyage_06_cam_caption_00,"Ok, uhhh, B... 84... "
Brian_BonVoyage_07_escapades_caption_00,"Ah, that is a situation. "
Brian_BonVoyage_07_escapades_caption_01,Perhaps our escapades yesterday caught a bit more attention than I thought.
Brian_BonVoyage_07_escapades_caption_02,"That’s a Planck security battalion, and if I’m not mistaken it’s the one led by- "
Brian_BonVoyage_08_officer13_caption_00,Officer 13. 
officer13_bonvoyage_00_brian_caption_00,Brian! Good to see you. How’s my favorite human?
Brian_BonVoyage_09_crap_caption_00,"Cut the crap 13, how did you find me here? "
officer13_bonvoyage_01_qr_caption_00,"Oh, Brian. You’re still within Quantum Reactor 7, it’s our job to know everything that happens within Quantum Reactor 7."
officer13_bonvoyage_01_qr_caption_01,Also...
Brian_BonVoyage_10_therusidea_caption_00,That was Therus’ idea!
Therus_BonVoyage_08_idea_caption_00,That was not my idea!

Therus_BonVoyage_09_yessir_caption_00,"Yes, sir."
officer13_bonvoyage_02_friend_caption_00,"So, Brian, who’s your little friend? A new science experiment?"
officer13_bonvoyage_02_friend_caption_01,Is Brian holding you against your will? Blink twice if--
Brian_BonVoyage_12_help_caption_00,"No, no no no, it’s not like that! "
Brian_BonVoyage_12_help_caption_01,"I’m trying to help her, I’m doing her a favor. "
officer13_bonvoyage_03_character_caption_00,"Hm, well that’s certainly out of character."
Brian_BonVoyage_13_heart_caption_00,"Maybe I’ve had a change of heart, 13. "
officer13_bonvoyage_04_troops_caption_00,Tell that to the dozens of security troops you and your friend killed yesterday.
Brian_BonVoyage_14_defending_caption_00,"Ah, well, you see, it was us or them. "
Brian_BonVoyage_14_defending_caption_01,We were just defending ourselves. 
officer13_bonvoyage_05_threat_caption_00,"You were trespassing on Planck property. Listen Brian, we’ve been putting up with your bullshit for years. "
officer13_bonvoyage_05_threat_caption_01,"But you’re a criminal and a fugitive, and I just can’t ignore an assault of yesterday’s magnitude."
officer13_bonvoyage_05_threat_caption_02,"You are officially a threat to the security of the Reactor, and I will be treating you as one from here on out."
Brian_BonVoyage_15_embarassing_caption_00,"Oh, this is embarrassing. "
officer13_bonvoyage_06_containment_caption_00,I know. I almost feel bad.
officer13_bonvoyage_06_containment_caption_01,"Let’s make this quick. Containment squad, bring the life forms to the transport."
Brian_BonVoyage_18_saved_caption_00,Hah! saved! 
Brian_BonVoyage_18_1_justintime_caption_00,Therus! You’re just in time! 
Therus_BonVoyage_10_dramatic_caption_00,Oh I've been right outside the door the whole time.
Therus_BonVoyage_10_dramatic_caption_01,I just wanted to be dramatic.
Brian_BonVoyage_19_follow_caption_00,Well you succeeded. 
Brian_BonVoyage_19_follow_caption_01,"Now, we’ve got no time to waste! "
Brian_BonVoyage_19_follow_caption_02,"Let’s get you on your way, Therus can fend off security for a few minutes."
Brian_BonVoyage_19_follow_caption_03,"Follow me, I have a secret tunnel leading to the recycling center that will take us around our friends outside. "
officer13_bonvoyage_07_surrounded_caption_00,"Brian, where do you think you’re going? We have your building surrounded."
Brian_BonVoyage_20_prompt_caption_00, Come on! 
Brian_BonVoyage_21_prompt2_caption_00,"Come on, no time to waste. "
Brian_BonVoyage_22_prompt3_caption_00,Hurry up! 
Brian_BonVoyage_23_prompt4_caption_00,"Hurry, we need to get you out of here. "
officer13_bonvoyage_08_terran_caption_00,"Oh, Brian! You can’t run away this time."
officer13_bonvoyage_08_terran_caption_01, Maybe we won’t take you to Exobiology after all. Maybe we’ll turn you over to the Terran Union.
officer13_bonvoyage_08_terran_caption_02,How do you think they would feel if they learned you’re alive and have been hiding in the reactor?
Brian_BonVoyage_24_prison_caption_00,"He’s just trying to freak me out. Not that it’s, uh, not working."
Brian_BonVoyage_24_prison_caption_01,I do not want to end up back in prison. Planck busted me out last time on the condition that I work for them.
Brian_BonVoyage_24_prison_caption_02, I don’t think they’d be so generous this time. 
Brian_BonVoyage_25_security_caption_00,"Don’t worry, my security will be able to hold them off for a bit. "
Brian_BonVoyage_25_security_caption_01,"Don’t try to help, keep moving. We need to get you out of here."
Brian_BonVoyage_26_goodbye_caption_00,This is it. This secret passage leads straight to the middle of the recycling center.
Brian_BonVoyage_26_goodbye_caption_01,"From there, you can continue down using the transit system, and eventually reach the core."
Brian_BonVoyage_26_goodbye_caption_02,"I’ll try to help guide you remotely, but- "
Brian_BonVoyage_26_goodbye_caption_03,But I’ve obviously got some troubles of my own. 
Brian_BonVoyage_26_goodbye_caption_04,You can’t rely on me to save you at the last moment.
Brian_BonVoyage_26_goodbye_caption_05,"A quantum reactor is one of the most actively hostile places on Earth, so be prepared. For anything. "
Brian_BonVoyage_26_goodbye_caption_06,"Goodbye, and good luck. "
Brian_Datamast_01_HopIn_caption_00,"Hey hey hey, look who didn't die."
Brian_Datamast_01_HopIn_caption_01,"Let's get going, I need my internet back! Hop in!"
Brian_Datamast_02_Liftoff_caption_00,"Alright! 3, 2, 1, liftoff!"
Brian_Datamast_00_internet_caption_00,This cavern pipes the internet from the surface all the way down here to the lower floors.
Brian_Datamast_00_internet_caption_01,"It's on the outskirts of the reactor though, doesn't see much of your usual activity,"
Brian_Datamast_00_internet_caption_02,which is why I built my home here.
Brian_Datamast_00_internet_caption_03,Nice and quiet most of the time.
Brian_Datamast_00_internet_caption_04,"Not today though, obviously."
Brian_Datamast_01_stop_caption_00,This is your stop!
Brian_Datamast_01_stop_caption_01,"I can't go any closer to the datamast, but it's just a short walk up the ridge."
Brian_Datamast_01_stop_caption_02,Get moving!
Brian_Datamast_07_securityTeam_caption_00,"Hey, I just intercepted a message from the Reactor's intercom network."
Brian_Datamast_07_securityTeam_caption_01,Looks like an internal repair and containment team beat us to the 'mast.
Brian_Datamast_07_securityTeam_caption_02,"I can't let them find the modifications I've made, so you need to take them out."
Brian_Datamast_07_securityTeam_caption_03,"Should be a peice of cake! A few repair drones, some standard model security bots, and one officer"
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_01_wtf_caption_00,What are you doing!? You can't fight a centaur!
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_01_wtf_caption_01,"Oh god I'm sorry, this is my fault."
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_01_wtf_caption_02,This whole datamast fiasco was just supposed to be an aptitude test.
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_01_wtf_caption_03,I came as soon as I saw they were sending backup.
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_01_wtf_caption_04,You must have really pissed them off. Let's just get out of here before-
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_02_backup_caption_00,Before the centaur calls in even more backup.
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_02_backup_caption_01,Shit.
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_02_backup_caption_02,"Okay, no time to lose. Get in, quick!"
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_03_wasting_caption_00,"Come on, stop wasting time! Get in the copter!"
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_04_minigun_caption_00,"If you look to the rear of the vehicle, you will notice a mounted 22 millimeter rotary cannon."
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_04_minigun_caption_01,"A little old fashioned, sure, but it’ll do the job. "
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_04_minigun_caption_02,“The job” being dispatching the incoming aerial support that I do not want to lead to my headquarters. 
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_05_contact_caption_00,And we have contact. Planck gunships are on our tail.  
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_06_missiles_caption_00,"Watch out, Missiles! Shoot them down! "
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_07_cockpit_caption_00,"What are you doing?! Get to the back of the ship, dumbass!"
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_07_cockpit_caption_01,"I don’t need your help up here, I need your help not getting shot down!"
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_08_cockpitB_caption_00,Get back to the tailgun!
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_09_missilesHit_caption_00,"Jesus, we’re taking a lot of hits! You need to shoot down those missiles! "
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_10_gunships_caption_00,Shoot those gunships down! 
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_11_windshield_caption_00,"Crap, there goes the rear windshield. We can’t take much more fire. "
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_12_death_caption_00,"Shit, engines are out. "
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_13_ending_caption_00,"Damn it, left engine’s jamming."
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_13_ending_caption_01,"I think HQ’s too far, we’re about to fall out of the sky."
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_13_ending_caption_02,If I take us down now I might be able to make it softer. 
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_13_ending_caption_03,You’re gonna want to hold on to something back there.
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_14_splashCountdown_caption_00,Okay... splashdown in 3... 2... 1... 
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_15_waterBrianFirst_caption_00,"Having fun swimming about, breathing underwater with your BAMM while I swim for my life, huh?"
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_15_waterBrianFirst_caption_01,"Wish I had one for myself, maybe once it’s less of a dangerous prototype."
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_15_waterBrianFirst_caption_02,"Hey, don’t look at me like that! It hasn’t killed you yet, has it?"
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_15_waterBrianFirst_caption_03,"Plus, you’re advancing science. "
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_16_waterSameTime_caption_00,Whew! That was kind of fun.
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_16_waterSameTime_caption_01,"Neither of us died, so I count today as another victory. "
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_17_waterBrianSecond_caption_00,Hey! Thanks for leaving me for dead down there. 
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_17_waterBrianSecond_caption_01,"Although, to be fair, “every man for himself” is literally the only thing written in the Iron Chub’s emergency handbook. "
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_17_waterBrianSecond_caption_02,Suppose you were just following procedure then.
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_17_waterBrianSecond_caption_03,It’s damn hard to swim without letting these slippers fall off though.
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_19_gohome_caption_00,"Let’s swim to shore, trek back to HQ."
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_19_gohome_caption_01,"I’ll set you up in a guest room, small step up from the holding cell you’ve been in for the last few weeks. "
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_19_gohome_caption_02, I want to get you moving and out of my life as soon as possible.
Brian_Datamast_Rescue_19_gohome_caption_03,Tomorrow... we can talk about what comes next. 
Therus_GrandTour_01_Greetings_caption_00,"There you are. My name’s Therus, I’m Brian’s main personal assistant. "
Therus_GrandTour_01_Greetings_caption_01,"Glorified secretary, really."
Therus_GrandTour_01_Greetings_caption_02,"Ah, just realised: yeah, I look like a reactor security drone. "
Therus_GrandTour_01_Greetings_caption_03,"Not to worry, fully rehabilitated."
Therus_GrandTour_01_Greetings_caption_04,"Brian captures us and reprograms us with stuff like free will, empathy, less stupid robotic voices. "
Therus_GrandTour_01_Greetings_caption_05,"Promise I won’t shoot you. Look, Brian even installed safeties in my guns- "
Therus_GrandTour_02_Startle_caption_00,Shit!
Therus_GrandTour_02_Startle_caption_01,Correction: Brian said he installed safeties in my guns. I’m so sorry.
Therus_GrandTour_02_Startle_caption_02,"Point is, you’re safe from Planck security here."
Therus_GrandTour_02_Startle_caption_03,Brian’s headquarters is tucked away in one of the quietest corners of the reactor.
Therus_GrandTour_02_Startle_caption_04,"Come on now, I’m supposed to give you a tour!"
Therus_GrandTour_03_Security_caption_00," So you fought your way up through 5 floors of the quantum reactor on your own, from what I’ve heard. Pretty impressive."
Therus_GrandTour_03_Security_caption_01,"Gotta warn you though, the security they use down on the lower floors is much more intense,"
Therus_GrandTour_03_Security_caption_02,as it really becomes a war zone the closer you get to the core. 
Therus_GrandTour_03_Security_caption_03,"Hundreds of aliens to be dispatched, on a slow day."
Therus_GrandTour_03_Security_caption_04,Gonna make the bots you fought on the way up look like children’s toys.   
Therus_GrandTour_04_Freezers_caption_00,"Oh, these are some of Brian's long term experiments."
Therus_GrandTour_04_Freezers_caption_01,Brian has been studying the life forms that are pulled here by the reactor.
Therus_GrandTour_04_Freezers_caption_02,"Luckily we already know a lot about your universe, and we know you're about genetically identical to the humans here."
Therus_GrandTour_04_Freezers_caption_03,Otherwise you'd be in one of those freezers.
Sylvia_GrandTour_01_ooo_caption_00,"Ooh, Therus, is this her?"
Therus_GrandTour_05_Sylvia_caption_00,"No Sylvia, it’s a different human from Vetus-4. "
Sylvia_GrandTour_02_fall_caption_00,"Hey, no need for the sass."
Sylvia_GrandTour_02_fall_caption_01,So is it true that you fell all the way from the surface to the recycling center in an elevator with faulty e-stasis?
Therus_GrandTour_06_brianFound_caption_00,Yep. Brian found her on a conveyor belt leading into a pit of molten metal. 
Therus_GrandTour_06_brianFound_caption_01,"Skull fractured, legs pretty much jelly, one arm lying 20 feet away.  "
Sylvia_GrandTour_03_nervemap_caption_00,"Dang, girl. Well, you’re looking much better now, that’s for sure. "
Sylvia_GrandTour_03_nervemap_caption_01,"Oh, Therus, while I’ve got you here, did you get the Aetherback nerve map I requested from Leo? "
Therus_GrandTour_07_Transfer_caption_00,"Oh yeah, Right here. I’ll transfer it to you. "
Therus_GrandTour_07_Transfer_caption_01,"Uh, Leo told me to tell you to please not treat them too badly? "
Sylvia_GrandTour_04_torture_caption_00,"Aww, Leo. He knows we have to torture them to get them to communicate with us, right?"
Sylvia_GrandTour_04_torture_caption_01,Aetherbacks are some of the most hostile sapients we’ve found. 
Therus_GrandTour_08_Aggressive_caption_00,"Yeah, yeah. It’s a shame too,"
Therus_GrandTour_08_Aggressive_caption_01,imagine what we could learn from them if they weren’t so stubbornly aggressive. 
Sylvia_GrandTour_05_suffer_caption_00," I suppose. Torture works too though, and it’s fun to make organic beings suffer."
Sylvia_GrandTour_05_suffer_caption_01,Uh- no offense.
Therus_GrandTour_09_getgoing_caption_00,"Oh right, uh, we should get going. "
Therus_GrandTour_09_getgoing_caption_01,"Sylvia, good to see you as always. Stay cool in there. "
Sylvia_GrandTour_06_bye_caption_00,"Very funny. See you around, Therus."
Therus_GrandTour_10_WeaponTable_caption_00,"Here, come to this table! Your primary weapon is here for you."
Therus_GrandTour_10_WeaponTable_caption_01,"This will probably be the most useful tool you'll have, possibly defining your entire journey!"
Therus_GrandTour_11_Crowbar_caption_00,"Oh, what's that peice of junk doing here."
Therus_GrandTour_11_Crowbar_caption_01,Ridiculous! We wouldn't possibly have you fighting deadly aliens in a high-tech facility using a crowbar.
Therus_GrandTour_11_Crowbar_caption_02,That would be absurd.
Therus_GrandTour_12_Ionizer_caption_00,And here you go! State of the art Triple Point Plasma Condenser.
Therus_GrandTour_12_Ionizer_caption_01,Shoot some targets in the water!
Therus_GrandTour_13_goodjob_caption_00,Great work. You’ll be murdering my brothers in no time.
Therus_GrandTour_13_goodjob_caption_01,I think that’s enough violence for now though. 
Therus_GrandTour_13_goodjob_caption_02,"Let’s move on, I’ve got 3 hours set aside to show you all the-"
Therus_GrandTour_14_Earthquake_caption_00,That is not supposed to happen. I do not know what that is. 
brian_GrandTour_04_uthere_caption_00,"Therus, are you there? Please respond."
Therus_GrandTour_15_what_caption_00,Sure am. What the hell was that? 
brian_GrandTour_05_cycle_caption_00,Looks like a particularly bad core cycle. Haven’t had one this potent in months. 
brian_GrandTour_05_cycle_caption_01,"The seismic activity is odd, but not unheard of. "
brian_GrandTour_05_cycle_caption_02," I’ll start standard lockdown, you just stay still for now. Be ready to fend off any visitors. "
Therus_GrandTour_16_roger_caption_00,Roger.
brian_GrandTour_06_crap_caption_00,"Ahh, crap, crap, crap, crap, crap."
Therus_GrandTour_17_what_caption_00,"Brian, what’s going on? "
brian_GrandTour_07_network_caption_00,The cycle’s seismic output is increasing a lot faster than usual.
brian_GrandTour_07_network_caption_01,A few elevator shafts just collapsed.
brian_GrandTour_07_network_caption_02,The network connection just went dark as well. I need to get back online for damage assessment ASAP.
brian_GrandTour_07_network_caption_03,"New girl, meet me in the hangar and we can fly over to repair the datamast. "
Therus_GrandTour_18_datamast_caption_00,The datamast? 
brian_GrandTour_08_datamast_caption_00,"Yes Therus, the datamast. "
Therus_GrandTour_19_why_caption_00,Why couldn’t- 
brian_GrandTour_09_datamast_caption_00," We need to go to the datamast, Therus! "
Therus_GrandTour_20_hangar_caption_00,"Jeez, okay. Do we have a clear route to the Hangar? "
brian_GrandTour_10_quarantine_caption_00,"You can reach me through the robot access passages, but it looks like the only human accessible route is through Sector 4."
brian_GrandTour_10_quarantine_caption_01,Which was just put under quarantine. 
Therus_GrandTour_21_quarantine_caption_00,"Ah. Okay bud, your only choice is to fight your way through."
Therus_GrandTour_21_quarantine_caption_01,"Shouldn’t be too bad, but I hope you got some good practice in the range. "
Therus_GrandTour_21_quarantine_caption_02, I’ll unlock the door and let you in. 
Therus_GrandTour_21_quarantine_caption_03,"Since the sector’s on lockdown, we won’t be able to communicate with you once you’re inside. "
Therus_GrandTour_21_quarantine_caption_04,"Follow the signs to the hangar, okay? Come on, follow me."
Therus_GrandTour_22_byebye_caption_00,See you on the other side. Stay alert in there. 
Therus_Quarantine_01_Greeting_caption_00,"No, I know Brian, but if she were still alive she would have arrived ages ago."
Therus_Quarantine_01_Greeting_caption_01,"Yeah, I know what Nani said, but Nani is bat-shit insane. It's not--"
Therus_Quarantine_01_Greeting_caption_02,"Oh, hey!"
Therus_Quarantine_01_Greeting_caption_03,Shh! She's here! It's fine. Shush.
Therus_Quarantine_01_Greeting_caption_04,I see you made it through just fine. Never doubted you would! 
Therus_Quarantine_01_Greeting_caption_05,"Now, Brian really wants his internet back, so let's get going."
Therus_Reaction_Excuse_caption_00,Excuse me.
Therus_Reaction_Hey_caption_00,Hey!
Therus_Reaction_Ouch_caption_00,Ouch.
Therus_RecyclingCenter_00_hey_caption_00,"Psst, hey! It’s Therus!"
Therus_RecyclingCenter_01_weird_caption_00,How are you doing? Doesn’t matter.
Therus_RecyclingCenter_01_weird_caption_01,"Listen, I’m risking my ass talking to you here. There’s something... weird going on."
Therus_RecyclingCenter_01_weird_caption_02,It seems like everyone I know is trying to get you to the reactor core.
Therus_RecyclingCenter_02_nani_caption_00,"There’s this guy, Nani, who told Brian to save you in the first place."
Therus_RecyclingCenter_02_nani_caption_01,"No offense, but you’re just a random alien, and Brian would never help you like he has for no reason."
Therus_RecyclingCenter_02_nani_caption_02,That would be... very out of character.
Therus_RecyclingCenter_03_playalong_caption_00,I’m going to try to dig some more; just play along for now.
Therus_RecyclingCenter_03_playalong_caption_01,I’m flashing your BAMM with some firmware that will let me contact you under the radar. 
brian_rebirth_00_awake_caption_00,Oh! You’re awake!
brian_rebirth_00_awake_caption_01,"Wasn’t expecting you up for another week or so, but I guess the nanites worked fast."
brian_rebirth_00_awake_caption_02,"My name’s Brian, welcome to my home."
brian_rebirth_00_awake_caption_03,I brought you here after your accident.
brian_rebirth_00_awake_caption_04,"Speaking of, how’s your brain feeling? Any memory lapses? "
brian_rebirth_01_recap_caption_00,Where to begin...
brian_rebirth_01_recap_caption_01,"We are inside Quantum Reactor 7, a vast underground power plant."
brian_rebirth_01_recap_caption_02,The primary side effect of quantum power is that alien life forms are yanked in from alternate universes.
brian_rebirth_01_recap_caption_03,"You’re from one of those universes, and you arrived here a couple months ago."
brian_rebirth_01_recap_caption_04,"You foolishly tried to escape the reactor, fighting through the security drones on the uppermost 5 floors,"
brian_rebirth_01_recap_caption_05,"but were stopped by my, uh, friend Gentlehand before you stuck your dumb head out a window and got the mountain obliterated for a containment breach. "
brian_rebirth_01_recap_caption_06,"Gentlehand took the precaution of dropping you down an elevator shaft, and, well, here you are. "
brian_rebirth_01_recap_caption_07,"Any of that sound familiar? Good, good. "
brian_rebirth_02_norecap_caption_00,I’ll take your word for it.
brian_rebirth_03_bamm_caption_00,"Oh, you had a little something of mine. The old spacetime manipulator. "
brian_rebirth_03_bamm_caption_01," I used this to fake my death, and you just steal it off my corpse. You’ve got nerve, I give you that."
brian_rebirth_03_bamm_caption_02,"I know you made use of it to stay alive thus far, so I’ve got a little something even more cutting edge for you now."
brian_rebirth_03_bamm_caption_03,I call it the BAMM. Biometric Arm-Mounted Multitool.
brian_rebirth_03_bamm_caption_04," Adds first-aid systems, magnetic storage, ammunition synthesis, all in a wearable package. Should come in handy. "
brian_rebirth_04_gottago_caption_00,"Damn it, bad timing."
brian_rebirth_04_gottago_caption_01,"Uh, I’ve got to go check on something."
brian_rebirth_04_gottago_caption_02,You get your Bamm configured and I’ll send you down to meet with my assistant Therus.
brian_rebirth_04_gottago_caption_03,He’ll give you a little tour of my home.
brian_rebirth_04_gottago_caption_04,Welcome to Brian Industries. 
Brian_RecyclingCenter_00_flee_caption_00,"Hey, guess what? I’m not dead yet."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_00_flee_caption_01,"Had to flee HQ for the time being, but that’s ok."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_00_flee_caption_02,"In a few days, security will have forgotten all about this unfortunate conflict. "
Brian_RecyclingCenter_00_flee_caption_03,Mostly because I’m deploying a virus into the mainframe that will wipe the records of the last 48 hours.
Brian_RecyclingCenter_00_flee_caption_04, I can see you’ve made it to the recycling center okay. 
Brian_RecyclingCenter_00_flee_caption_05,"You’ll want to make your way to the transit system, that’s the fastest way to reach the core."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_00_flee_caption_06,"There will be some signage around, but honestly just keep moving down."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_00_flee_caption_07,Sound good? Good. 
Brian_RecyclingCenter_01_alien_caption_00,"Hey, sorry to be out of contact for a bit. I’ve been busy taking back my headquarters from security."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_01_alien_caption_01,"They didn’t get too far in, thank goodness. "
Brian_RecyclingCenter_01_alien_caption_02,"Not the first time I’ve had to deal with a little invasion, probably not the last either."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_01_alien_caption_03,"Anyway, it looks like you’re almost at the bottom of the recycling center, which is great!"
Brian_RecyclingCenter_01_alien_caption_04,"What’s not great, though, uh, is that I’m picking up security chatter about a dangerous escaped alien near your location."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_01_alien_caption_05,"An alien besides you, that is."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_01_alien_caption_06,"Just... watch out, ok? Ok."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_01_alien_caption_07,"Hey Therus, can you grab 20 magnetic transport carts from storage?  "
Brian_RecyclingCenter_01_alien_caption_08,Therus? 
Brian_RecyclingCenter_01_alien_caption_09,Damn it. I haven’t heard from Therus in hours. No idea where he’s run off to. 
Brian_RecyclingCenter_01_alien_caption_10,"Listen, I’ve got to go, I have several hundred robot corpses to dispose of."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_01_alien_caption_11,"Keep an eye out for that big scary alien, yeah? Brian out."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_02_containing_caption_00,"Oh dear, this looks like the place they were containing the alien."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_02_containing_caption_01,It’s not a good sign when they don’t bother moving it to Exobiology. Means it’s too dangerous to transport. 
Brian_RecyclingCenter_03_igneosaur_caption_00,"Well, that confirms my fears."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_03_igneosaur_caption_01,"That’s a juvenile Igneosaur. Extremely dangerous, silicon based, magma-dwelling life form. "
Brian_RecyclingCenter_03_igneosaur_caption_02,"They’re rare, but create quite a mess when they do make it into the reactor. "
Brian_RecyclingCenter_04_geothermal_caption_00," Oh, a geothermal outpost! "
Brian_RecyclingCenter_04_geothermal_caption_01," I’ve visited these before, it should have an elevator inside that takes you directly to the transit system. "
Brian_RecyclingCenter_05_detour_caption_00,"Oh, there we go. Lost my connection with you for a few minutes."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_05_detour_caption_01,Must have been the magma interfering.
Brian_RecyclingCenter_05_detour_caption_02,"Speaking of magma, uh, this elevator shaft seems to be full of the stuff."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_05_detour_caption_03,That is unfortunate.
Brian_RecyclingCenter_05_detour_caption_04,"It’s ok, quick detour, you’re super close to the transit system. "
Brian_RecyclingCenter_06_dead_caption_00,"That thing is not dead, you’ve just pissed it off."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_06_dead_caption_01,Try to get out of here while you can! 
Brian_RecyclingCenter_07_toldyou_caption_00, I told you! I told you! Not dead!
Brian_RecyclingCenter_07_toldyou_caption_01,"Keep going, get to higher ground! "
Brian_RecyclingCenter_08_specimen_caption_00,"Excellent. That should keep it quiet, for the time being."
Brian_RecyclingCenter_08_specimen_caption_01,"A great specimen, wish I could bring it in for study. "
Brian_PITS_01_pits_caption_00,"Finally, you've reached the PITS, the Planck Internal Transit System."
Brian_PITS_01_pits_caption_01,"You rode it on the way up to the surface as well, right?"
Brian_PITS_01_pits_caption_02," This station has been idle since evac, of course, but it looks like it's still in working order."
Brian_PITS_01_pits_caption_03,"There’s a train nearby, I’ll call it in. "
Brian_PITS_02_crash_caption_00,Okay that was my bad. That was on me.
Brian_PITS_02_crash_caption_01,"Shit, that was the only train anywhere near here."
Brian_PITS_02_crash_caption_02," I can’t control track switches, so you’re going to have to reroute another train using this station’s control tower."
Brian_PITS_02_crash_caption_03,Do you see it? Out in the tunnel past the tracks. 
Brian_PITS_02_crash_caption_04,"Make your way to the tower, and I’ll help you from there. "
Brian_PITS_03_foot_caption_00,"Trust me, you should not try to traverse the PITS on foot."
Brian_PITS_03_foot_caption_01,I’ve tried.
Brian_PITS_03_foot_caption_02,"Head to the control tower to call in a train, okay?"
Brian_PITS_04_crab_caption_00,"Wow, that is a big crab."
Brian_PITS_04_crab_caption_01,That is the biggest crab I’ve ever seen. 
Brian_PITS_05_controls_caption_00,"Ah, perfect. This is what I can’t hack into remotely, the track switch controls. "
Brian_PITS_05_controls_caption_01,"Figure out how to route another train to this station, so you can get the hell out of the recycling center."
Brian_PITS_05_controls_caption_02,"The control tower should be better at, uh, braking, than I am. "
Brian_PITS_06_centuar_caption_00,"Great, that should do it."
Brian_PITS_06_centuar_caption_01," It will take a few minutes for the train to arrive, so you should head back to the station floor."
Brian_PITS_06_centuar_caption_02,"And yes, there seems to be a Centaur there that you’ll have to take care of."
Brian_PITS_06_centuar_caption_03,No chance that thing lets you onto a train unless it’s dead.  
Brian_PITS_07_centaur_caption_00,"What- uh- ok, my connection with you was just jammed. Back now."
Brian_PITS_07_centaur_caption_01,I didn’t think Planck could do that.
Brian_PITS_07_centaur_caption_02,"Anyway, listen: Centaurs are Planck’s most heavily armoured security units:"
Brian_PITS_07_centaur_caption_03,"their entire body is essentially invulnerable, even to explosives."
Brian_PITS_07_centaur_caption_04,"Their one weak point is their head, which of course has its own shielding you have to break through."
Brian_PITS_07_centaur_caption_05,Focus your fire there. 
Brian_PITS_08_train_caption_00,Nice. Centaur down. 
Brian_PITS_08_train_caption_01,"Here comes the train too, impeccable timing!  "
Brian_PITS_09_trainprompt_caption_00,"Come on, get on the train. No use wasting time. "
Brian_PITS_10_seismic_caption_00,"Uh, weird seismic activity detected on the tracks ahead "
Brian_PITS_11_bigcrab_caption_00,CRAB! Big crab.
Brian_PITS_11_bigcrab_caption_01,"Big, big crab. Slow down, back up, do not go near the big crab! "
Brian_PITS_11_bigcrab_caption_02,Stop! STOP! Stop the train!! Emergency brake or something!
Brian_PITS_11_bigcrab_caption_03,CRAB! 
Therus_PITS_00_void_caption_00,Hello hello?
Therus_PITS_00_void_caption_01,Therus here. I can only talk for a moment. 
Therus_PITS_00_void_caption_02,"Listen, do you know anything about the Void Delegation?"
Therus_PITS_00_void_caption_03,"There’s this space between universes, this higher extradimensional space called the Void, which I sort of knew about from some of Brian’s experiments."
Therus_PITS_00_void_caption_04,"Turns out the Void has a government, the Delegation, and they seem to be in contact with Nani."
Therus_PITS_00_void_caption_05,"Nani won’t tell me much, but I think the Void Delegation wants some artifact from this universe.There’s some ritual that needs to be carried out to get it back."
Therus_PITS_00_void_caption_06,"I’m still translating the rest of the scriptures, so I’ll know more soon."
Therus_PITS_00_void_caption_07,"I’ll meet you at the far end of the transit system, okay?"
Therus_PITS_00_void_caption_08,"I’ll be able to disable the BAMM’s tracking and we can escape from Brian, figure out what the hell is going on, and make a plan. "
Therus_AlienCaves_00_hey_caption_00,Hey!
Therus_AlienCaves_00_hey_caption_01,Hey! Up here!
Therus_AlienCaves_00_hey_caption_02,"I tried to follow you down here, but this damn plant caught me."
Therus_AlienCaves_00_hey_caption_03,Can you try to get me down from here? 
Therus_AlienCaves_01_please_caption_00,"Please, come on, I need a hand here. "
Therus_AlienCaves_02_thanks_caption_00,"Oh, thank you! The acid in that thing was just about to start eating through my hull. "
Therus_AlienCaves_03_Henrique_caption_00,"Anyway, listen, here’s what I’ve determined."
Therus_AlienCaves_03_Henrique_caption_01,"The Void Delegation deployed an agent, Henrique, on an unimportant mission to this universe about 8 months ago. "
Therus_AlienCaves_03_Henrique_caption_02,"But Henrique happened across... something, here. It doesn’t translate very well."
Therus_AlienCaves_03_Henrique_caption_03,"Something they worship is in our world, and they really really really want it back."
Therus_AlienCaves_04_Catalyst_caption_00,"Henrique needs two things to open a gateway for the Void’s armies: a black hole, and the Catalyst."
Therus_AlienCaves_04_Catalyst_caption_01," I’m pretty sure Brian doesn’t know any of this, he’s just trying to get to some technology near the reactor core."
Therus_AlienCaves_04_Catalyst_caption_02," Nani’s using him, on Henrique’s instruction, to bring you down there, because- "
Therus_AlienCaves_05_Gasp_caption_00,[gasp]
Therus_AlienCaves_06_Henrique_caption_00,Henrique...
brian_greatsea_00_gotcha_caption_00,"Got you, Gentlehand!"
brian_greatsea_00_gotcha_caption_01,"W- wait a second, what are you doing here?"
brian_greatsea_00_gotcha_caption_02,"Ah, it doesn’t matter. I was following some weird transmissions, thought they were from someone else."
brian_greatsea_00_gotcha_caption_03, Must have just been your BAMM acting up.
brian_greatsea_00_gotcha_caption_04,"Anyway, turns out you’re not dead, so that’s... news."
brian_greatsea_00_gotcha_caption_05,"I’ll try to come and meet you at the far shore. You’re still mostly on track to the reactor core, I suppose. "
brian_greatsea_00_gotcha_caption_06,"Now, I hate to leave you so soon, but I may have been followed out here, and this drone is expensive."
brian_greatsea_00_gotcha_caption_07,Catch you later.
brian_greatsea_01_shotdown_caption_00,"Ah, those little shits."
brian_greatsea_01_shotdown_caption_01,Avenge meeeeee- 
brian_reunion_00_rescue_caption_00,"Well, Brian to the rescue again I see. "
brian_reunion_00_rescue_caption_01,This better be the last time. 
brian_reunion_00_rescue_caption_02,"Get in, quick. As you may have noticed, Planck doesn’t make any effort to control alien life outside the reactor facility. "
brian_reunion_01_arch_caption_00,Shit! It’s coming for us now!
brian_reunion_01_arch_caption_01,"That’s an archyosathus, and the biggest one I’ve ever seen."
brian_reunion_01_arch_caption_02,"No chance we can kill it, but the minigun might slow it down. "
brian_reunion_02_persistent_caption_00,"My god, that thing is persistent. "
brian_reunion_02_persistent_caption_01,It’s like it knows how many of its eggs I have stored back at HQ. Keep shooting! 
brian_reunion_03_safe_caption_00,I think we’re safe. You can thank my incredible piloting skills.
brian_reunion_03_safe_caption_01,Up ahead there’s a secure gateway back into the PITS;
brian_reunion_03_safe_caption_02,we’ll get you back on track at long last.
brian_reunion_03_safe_caption_03," I don’t know how you did it, but you actually made it closer to the reactor core. "
brian_reunion_03_safe_caption_04,We’re all the way down at floor 8 now.
Brian_caves_00_signal_caption_00,Hello-
Brian_caves_00_signal_caption_01,I repeat-
Brian_caves_00_signal_caption_02,The signal is extremely weak.
Brian_caves_00_signal_caption_03,Communications damaged-
brian_deeplabs_00_train_caption_00,"Okay. You may notice I have stopped the train, and we are not yet at the reactor core."
brian_deeplabs_00_train_caption_01, Time for confession part 2. 
brian_deeplabs_00_train_caption_02,The intel Nani shared with me was regarding a secret laboratory deep within the reactor.
brian_deeplabs_00_train_caption_03,It may hold incredible scientific discoveries just beyond my grasp.
brian_deeplabs_00_train_caption_04,"And since it is directly on the way to the core, the thought crossed my mind, why don’t we make a little pit stop! "
brian_deeplabs_00_train_caption_05,"Okay, admittedly, I planned this from the beginning. It’s the reason I agreed to help you. "
brian_deeplabs_00_train_caption_06,"Stop glaring, I can see you! Listen, I’m a scientist, I can’t turn down free stolen research up for grabs."
brian_deeplabs_00_train_caption_07,"I can’t get down there to access them myself, but you can get in and scan everything for me."
brian_deeplabs_00_train_caption_08," You do that, I get you to the core and send you on your way. It’s a fair deal, a win-win."
brian_deeplabs_00_train_caption_09,"Come on, It’ll be a quick detour. "
brian_deeplabs_00_train_caption_10,One last place to explore before you get to go home.
brian_deeplabs_01_hack_caption_00,There’s a console on the back wall of this storage room that I can hack using codes Nani gave me.
brian_deeplabs_01_hack_caption_01, Just hold the BAMM up to it. 
brian_deeplabs_02_real_caption_00,"Holy shit, it worked. This might be real."
brian_deeplabs_02_real_caption_01,I didn’t even know if the Deep Labs were real.
brian_deeplabs_02_real_caption_02,"They’re supposedly such top secret, only Emily and an elite group of her scientists have ever entered them. "
brian_deeplabs_02_real_caption_03,"I’m a little jealous I was never invited, honestly. "
brian_deeplabs_03_down_caption_00,Down we go. 
brian_deeplabs_04_incredible_caption_00," Incredible. All this time, this was down here. "
emily_deeplabs_00_message_caption_00,"Hello team, it’s Emily again. Last minute change of plans."
emily_deeplabs_00_message_caption_01,"Dr. Morgan determined it’s too dangerous to disassemble the Vortex Propagator, so we’re going to be leaving it behind."
emily_deeplabs_00_message_caption_02,"It’ll take a chunk of our budget to rebuild it,"
emily_deeplabs_00_message_caption_03,but I’d rather take a financial hit than blow ourselves up.
emily_deeplabs_00_message_caption_04,"In about five years the exotic matter will have decayed enough to be safe,"
emily_deeplabs_00_message_caption_05,and we can send down a salvage team at that time.
emily_deeplabs_00_message_caption_06,"Anyway, the Daedalus Crater headquarters is up and running and ready to receive shipments of all other equipment as planned."
brian_deeplabs_05_fascinating_caption_00, Exotic matter. Fascinating. 
brian_deeplabs_05_fascinating_caption_01,Nani said they were working on a new method of interuniversal travel. That must be it.
brian_deeplabs_05_fascinating_caption_02,And they left equipment behind!
brian_deeplabs_05_fascinating_caption_03,"I’ll be able to scan everything safely--well, safe for me--and reverse engineer their technology. "
brian_deeplabs_05_fascinating_caption_04,This changes everything. 
brian_deeplabs_05_fascinating_caption_05,"Well come on, start exploring! "
brian_deeplabs_06_data_caption_00,"Oh, that’s a lot of data. Delicious. Keep it coming. "
brian_deeplabs_07_data_caption_00,This isn’t even encrypted.
brian_deeplabs_07_data_caption_01,"There are raw CAD files in here, timelines, documentation, terabytes of experimental results."
brian_deeplabs_07_data_caption_02,"As someone who loves stealing, this is the best day of my life. "
brian_deeplabs_08_data_caption_00,"Whoa, this is the most complete database of alternate universes I’ve ever seen. "
brian_deeplabs_08_data_caption_01,They’ve sent fucking probes to alternate earths. There are photos in here. This should be impossible.
brian_deeplabs_08_data_caption_02,This just completely shames my research.
brian_deeplabs_08_data_caption_03,There’s no reason to rely on studying the alien fauna from MXEs when you can just explore the universes themselves. 
brian_deeplabs_08_data_caption_04,This is too much.
brian_deeplabs_08_data_caption_05,I have to start thoroughly combing through this data. Keep scanning and exploring. 
brian_deeplabs_10_portal_caption_00,"Oh my, this must be the prototype portal between universes. "
brian_deeplabs_10_portal_caption_01,Obviously they didn’t perfect it. 
brian_deeplabs_10_portal_caption_02," I wouldn’t touch it, Emily said it’s unstable."
brian_deeplabs_10_portal_caption_03,And that was before being left to decay down here for a year.
brian_deeplabs_11_what_caption_00,"Uh, what are you doing?"
brian_deeplabs_12_caution_caption_00,"I’m usually not one for caution, but I really don’t think you should turn that thing on right now."
brian_deeplabs_12_caution_caption_01,They wouldn’t have abandoned it if it worked properly. 
brian_deeplabs_12_caution_caption_02,There’s no way to know what will happen if you flip these switches.
brian_deeplabs_13_badnews_caption_00,"Hey, are you listening to me? Scary Anti-Symmetry equals bad news."
brian_deeplabs_13_badnews_caption_01,Just because it’s supposed to be a portal between universes doesn’t mean it will take you where you want to go.
brian_deeplabs_13_badnews_caption_02,This isn’t gonna end well.
brian_deeplabs_14_thankgoodness_caption_00,"Oh, thank goodness. "
brian_deeplabs_15_godssake_caption_00,For god’s sake.  
brian_deeplabs_16_rebellion_caption_00,I have done nothing but help you and support you. And you repay me with what? This?
brian_deeplabs_16_rebellion_caption_01,"You’re going to wreck the whole place. You’re right next to the reactor core, you know. "
brian_deeplabs_16_rebellion_caption_02,"You’ll destabilize it, blow up half the continent.  "
brian_deeplabs_17_idiot_caption_00,"You’re an idiot. You know what, go ahead. Blow it up. "
brian_deeplabs_18_sarcastic_caption_00,"That was supposed to be sarcastic, you dipshit. "
brian_deeplabs_19_archives_caption_00,"Okay, looking at the floors... We should probably start at archives."
brian_deeplabs_19_archives_caption_01,Should be able to download everything from there.
brian_deeplabs_19_archives_caption_02,Then you can see if there’s any interesting hardware left behind in the labs. 
brian_deeplabs_20_employeeSealed_caption_00,"Looks locked. That’s ok, I doubt there’s anything interesting in here. "
brian_deeplabs_21_archivesSealed_caption_00,"Shit, they barricaded the archives off pretty well. "
brian_deeplabs_21_archivesSealed_caption_01,There might be another way in though. Let’s just keep exploring the other floors for now.
brian_deeplabs_21_archivesSealed_caption_02,The labs might have some data as well.
brian_deeplabs_22_cybernetics_caption_00,I have no idea what kind of work they might have been doing in here.
brian_deeplabs_22_cybernetics_caption_01,"Might be interesting to take a look, but I’m more interested in the multiverse labs. "
brian_deeplabs_23_comms_caption_00,"Shit, something’s interfering with communications- "
brian_deeplabs_24_commsBack_caption_00,"Okay, communication’s back. Stupid interference."
brian_deeplabs_24_commsBack_caption_01,Maybe I should have come down there in person.
brian_deeplabs_24_commsBack_caption_02,At least it seems like it’s only in the Cybernetics labs. 
brian_deeplabs_25_weaponsSealed_caption_00,"Damn it, sealed as well. "
brian_deeplabs_25_weaponsSealed_caption_01,Oh well. Planck’s weapons research hasn’t been too interesting in the past.
brian_deeplabs_25_weaponsSealed_caption_02,I’ll just tell myself I’m not missing out
brian_deeplabs_26_multiverselabs_caption_00,This should be good. Let’s see what Planck has been getting up to down here. 
brian_deeplabs_27_activeseal_caption_00, God damn it. I thought it was odd they hadn’t sealed this floor like the others. 
brian_deeplabs_27_activeseal_caption_01,Well that’s a dead end for now. 
brian_deeplabs_27_activeseal_caption_02,"This is an active seal though, which means it should be easier to overcome."
brian_deeplabs_27_activeseal_caption_03,"Check some of the other floors, there must be something that can help us. "
brian_deeplabs_28_key_caption_00,"Oh shit, did you get a keycard from the Cybernetics floor? "
brian_deeplabs_28_key_caption_01,"Fantastic! Finally, let’s see some of the interesting stuff. "
brian_deeplabs_29_scan_caption_00,Yes! This is what I’m talking about. 
brian_deeplabs_29_scan_caption_01,"Come on, scan some of these servers for me. "
brian_degenerate_00_showup_caption_00,"Well, well, well. Look who decided to show up."
brian_degenerate_00_showup_caption_01,"While you’ve been bouncing between dimensions, the reactor core has quite possibly been irretrievably destabilized. "
brian_degenerate_00_showup_caption_02,"What on earth compelled you to activate that portal, anyway? "
gentlehand_degenerate_00_blame_caption_00,I'm afraid I must take the blame for that.
brian_degenerate_01_encypted_caption_00,"Wha- Gentlehand, this is an encrypted channel!"
brian_degenerate_01_encypted_caption_01,What are you doing on here?! 
gentlehand_degenerate_01_codes_caption_00,"Come now, Brian. You didn't really think I don't know your codes?"
brian_degenerate_02_die_caption_00,"I mean, I kind of hoped you didn’t."
brian_degenerate_02_die_caption_01,"That doesn’t matter now, though. We’re all about to die.  "
gentlehand_degenerate_02_plan_caption_00,"About that. Young lady, if you hurry to the reactor core, Brian's plan might still work."
gentlehand_degenerate_02_plan_caption_01,I apologize for directing you towards the obviously flawed Vortex Propagator
brian_degenerate_03_understatement_caption_00,That’s an understatement.  
gentlehand_degenerate_03_tell_caption_00,"Brian, tell her what to do."
gentlehand_degenerate_03_what_caption_00,"Brian, what needs to be done?"
brian_degenerate_04_plan_caption_00,"Uh, reach the core, hop in a maintenance pod, and perform an emergency release. "
brian_degenerate_04_plan_caption_01,You’ll naturally fall into the black hole in the core.
brian_degenerate_04_plan_caption_02,"I’ll carefully tune and time a power surge to the gravity wavefront inhibitors,"
brian_degenerate_04_plan_caption_03,"bing bang boom, you’re nice and snug back home, the core restabilizes, and Gentlehand and I hopefully don’t die. "
gentlehand_degenerate_04_getgoing_caption_00,"I like the sound of that. Come on now, we're running out of time!"
brian_degenerate_05_berlin_caption_00,"I get that you two weren’t around in 1989, but when the Berlin quantum reactor was blown up, half a million people were killed in one day."
brian_degenerate_05_berlin_caption_01,This quantum reactor is orders of magnitude larger than the one that destroyed Berlin. 
brian_degenerate_05_berlin_caption_02,"Just in case, uh, you weren’t aware of the severity of the situation."
brian_degenerate_08_waves_caption_00," I’m picking up gravitational waves all the way up here at HQ. You need to hurry, core stability is going down quick. "
gentlehand_degenerate_07_alive_caption_00," It’s more important she gets there alive, Brian. "
brian_degenerate_09_corpse_caption_00," I suppose. However, throwing her corpse with enough velocity could- "
gentlehand_degenerate_08_brian_caption_00,Brian! 
brian_degenerate_10_options_caption_00,I’m just saying. We have options. 
brian_degenerate_11_stronghold_caption_00,"Shit. Okay, I assumed the security was too fragmented by the destabilization to fortify the reactor core, but this security stronghold is still standing."
brian_degenerate_11_stronghold_caption_01, Barely. 
brian_degenerate_11_stronghold_caption_02,"The only way to the core is through that pyramid, you have to get inside. "
gentlehand_degenerate_09_idea_caption_00,"Wait, Brian, I have an idea. "
gentlehand_degenerate_09_idea_caption_01,Can you patch me into the intercom in that chamber? 
brian_degenerate_12_sure_caption_00,"Uh, sure. "
brian_degenerate_12_sure_caption_01,"Okay, you’re in. "
gentlehand_degenerate_10_please_caption_00,"Greetings, Planck security forces. "
gentlehand_degenerate_10_please_caption_01,We are attempting to stabilize the reactor core and prevent a collapse. 
gentlehand_degenerate_10_please_caption_02,Please allow us access to the core so we may-
brian_degenerate_13_nicely_caption_00,"Christ, Gentlehand, that was your idea? Asking nicely? "
gentlehand_degenerate_11_reason_caption_00,I thought I might reason with them. 
brian_degenerate_14_locks_caption_00,"Okay, good progress. That’s one of the locks keeping the stronghold sealed. "
brian_degenerate_14_locks_caption_01,You’ll need to get the other three as well. 
brian_degenerate_14_locks2_caption_00,Half the locks done. Keep it up. 
brian_degenerate_14_locks3_caption_00,Only one more lock left! 
brian_degenerate_15_1_core_caption_00,"Great. Get inside. Next stop, reactor core. "
brian_degenerate_15_hostiles_caption_00,"Shit, they have one more layer of security."
brian_degenerate_15_hostiles_caption_01,You’ll have to take out all these hostiles before it lets you in. 
brian_degenerate_15_locks4_caption_00,That’s all the locks! Hurry and get to one of the entrances! 
brian_degenerate_16_joejeffs_caption_00,What is this? JoeJeffs? How did they all get in here? Did Planck... 
brian_degenerate_16_joejeffs_caption_01,"Ah, oh dear. I know what’s going on."
brian_degenerate_16_joejeffs_caption_02,"Planck is attempting to summon a creature so powerful, so dominant, it rules an entire universe. "
brian_degenerate_16_joejeffs_caption_03," This must be their last, most desperate line of defense.  "
brian_degenerate_17_1_ready_caption_00,"No, no, no, what’s this, they were ready for this? Are you kidding? "
brian_degenerate_17_1_ready_caption_01,It looks like they may have been busier than we thought in the deep labs. 
brian_degenerate_17_joseph_caption_00,Joseph Jeffrey. 
officer13_degenerate_00_terrorist_caption_00,I should have known Brian and his little pet were responsible for this. 
officer13_degenerate_00_terrorist_caption_01,"You terrorist piece of shit, I can’t believe I trusted you, I let you go. "
officer13_degenerate_00_terrorist_caption_02,I’ll never forgive myself for not shooting you the moment I saw you in that fish. I’ve lost my edge.
brian_degenerate_18_officer_caption_00,Our friend Officer 13!
brian_degenerate_18_officer_caption_01,But how did he get his memory back?
brian_degenerate_18_officer_caption_02,What’s this about a fish?
brian_degenerate_18_officer_caption_03,"13, buddy, let’s talk this out!"
officer13_degenerate_01_reactor_caption_00,I won’t let you blow up the reactor. You’ve done enough damage. This ends here.
brian_degenerate_19_canthear_caption_00,"Damn it, he can’t hear me. He doesn’t know we’re trying to stabilize the core. "
officer13_degenerate_02_crush_caption_00,I’ll crush you into a fucking two dimensional entity!!
officer13_degenerate_03_defy_caption_00,You defy Planck! 
officer13_degenerate_04_giveup_caption_00,Give up! This is the closest you’ll ever get to the core!
officer13_degenerate_05_hunt_caption_00,"Brian, are you listening? I’ll hunt you down next! "
officer13_degenerate_05_hunt_caption_01,With Cyberjoseph I can reach your headquarters in less than fifteen minutes!
brian_degenerate_20_chance_caption_00,"I do believe him. Let’s not give him the chance, please. "
officer13_degenerate_06_killed_caption_00,I should have killed Brian years ago! 
officer13_degenerate_06_killed_caption_01,"Officer 2 recommended it, If only I had listened!!"
officer13_degenerate_07_forwhat_caption_00,"You’re blowing up the reactor, Brian, and for what?! Money? "
officer13_degenerate_07_forwhat_caption_01,"Or worse, are you actually sympathetic to the lunar separatists?"
brian_degenerate_21_political_caption_00,Ridiculous. Officer 13 knows I’m not political. 
brian_degenerate_21_political_caption_01,"Would probably do it for money, though. "
officer13_degenerate_08_humanoid_caption_00,"Why don’t you come down here yourself, Brian? "
officer13_degenerate_08_humanoid_caption_01,Why send this humanoid to do your dirty work? 
officer13_degenerate_09_sanitation_caption_00,When I’m done with you there will be nothing for the sanitation drones to clean up!
officer13_degenerate_10_tired_caption_00,"Cyberjoseph doesn’t get tired, and neither do I! "
officer13_degenerate_10_tired_caption_01,We will grease our hydraulics with your blood!
officer13_degenerate_11_dead_caption_00,"I’m shocked you’re not dead yet, but we have time to fix that!"
officer13_degenerate_12_inevitable_caption_00,You think you can kill Cyberjoseph like any other robot? 
officer13_degenerate_12_inevitable_caption_01,Even the meat nailer is just denting me. You’re delaying the inevitable! Give up and I’ll end this quickly.
brian_degenerate_22_archives_caption_00,"I’m worried he’s right, this thing is unkillable with conventional weaponry."
brian_degenerate_22_archives_caption_01,I’ve never seen armor like this before.
brian_degenerate_22_archives_caption_02,"Fuck, give me a minute. I’m checking my archives.  "
brian_degenerate_23_antimatter_caption_00,"Yes! Ok, ok. Listen, your BAMM noted in the deep labs that Cyberjoes’ weakness is antimatter. "
brian_degenerate_23_antimatter_caption_01,I can flash your Annihilator with experimental firmware.
brian_degenerate_23_antimatter_caption_02,A high intensity antimatter particle beam is the only hope to kill something like this. 
brian_degenerate_23_antimatter_caption_03,"This is going to absolutely melt your gun though, sorry in advance."
brian_degenerate_23_antimatter_caption_04,Transmitting the update now... 
brian_degenerate_24_fire_caption_00,"Fire, give him everything you’ve got! "
officer13_degenerate_13_possible_caption_00,What is this!? How is this possible?
brian_degenerate_25_working_caption_00,Yes! It’s working! Thank god!  
officer13_degenerate_14_damaging_caption_00,"No, no, this can’t happen, how are you damaging my armor?!"
brian_degenerate_26_antishit_caption_00,"Eat anti-shit, 13! "
officer13_degenerate_15_firepower_caption_00,How... How do you have the firepower to counter Cyberjoseph?! 
officer13_degenerate_16_survive_caption_00,Why would you fight for Brian? Do you think he’s on your side?
officer13_degenerate_16_survive_caption_01,Do you think you were ever supposed to survive this?!
officer13_degenerate_17_service_caption_00,I won’t give up! I won’t stop until the reactor is safe! 
officer13_degenerate_17_service_caption_01,"I can’t die now, after so many years of perfect service!"
officer13_degenerate_18_award_caption_00,I will not lose my employee of the month award!
officer13_degenerate_19_failed_caption_00,I’ve failed... The reactor is doomed...
brian_degenerate_27_drama_caption_00,"Oh, what a drama queen."
brian_degenerate_27_drama_caption_01,Bring the BAMM over to him so he can hear me. 
brian_degenerate_28_restabilize_caption_00,"Hey 13. Listen you moron, we’re not trying to blow up the reactor core, we’re trying to restabilize it."
brian_degenerate_28_restabilize_caption_01,It got fucked up by a piece of experimental tech in the deep labs that went haywire.
brian_degenerate_28_restabilize_caption_02,I have a plan to stop the core from blowing up. 
officer13_degenerate_20_ok_caption_00,Oh.
officer13_degenerate_20_ok_caption_01,"Yeah, ok."
brian_degenerate_29_really_caption_00,Really? 
officer13_degenerate_21_carriedaway_caption_00,"Yeah, I mean, that checks out. "
officer13_degenerate_21_carriedaway_caption_01,Epicenter of the initial explosion was in the deep labs.
officer13_degenerate_21_carriedaway_caption_02,"Plus your headquarters is in the reactor, and I know you don’t want that to get destroyed. "
officer13_degenerate_21_carriedaway_caption_03,You’re probably not terrorists. I just got a little carried away.
brian_degenerate_30_readonable_caption_00,"See, I always knew you were reasonable."
brian_degenerate_30_readonable_caption_01,I’m glad I don’t have to have my friend annihilate you. 
officer13_degenerate_22_help_caption_00,Anything I can do to help you folks?
brian_degenerate_31_standdown_caption_00,"Uh, you could tell all Planck security to stand down and let us access the core. "
officer13_degenerate_23_done_caption_00,"Done. This better work, Brian."
brian_degenerate_32_dead_caption_00,"If it doesn’t, I’ll be dead just like you. "
officer13_degenerate_24_prompt_caption_00,Don’t you have somewhere to be? I’ll get myself out of here. Go fix the damn core.
brian_degenerate_33_necessary_caption_00,Jesus christ! Was that necessary?! He was already down!  
brian_degenerate_33_necessary_caption_01,I suppose he did try to kill you.
brian_degenerate_33_necessary_caption_02,And you’ve spent your entire trip here killing security.
brian_degenerate_33_necessary_caption_03, I can’t really blame you.
brian_degenerate_33_necessary_caption_04,"Fuck. Just check with me next time before killing my friends, okay? "
brian_degenerate_34_prompt_caption_00,Come on. Clock’s still ticking. Let’s get to the core. 
brian_eventhorizon_00_atlast_caption_00,This is it. At last. 
brian_eventhorizon_01_radiation_caption_00,"The cosmic radiation you’re being exposed to right now is immense, of course, but the BAMM should take care of your health.  "
brian_eventhorizon_01_radiation_caption_01,There’s a science station suspended out there. That’s where we’ll be able to find drop pods.
brian_eventhorizon_01_radiation_caption_02," I already have a program loaded to settle the core back into stability and slingshot you home,"
brian_eventhorizon_01_radiation_caption_03,you just have to reach them. 
brian_eventhorizon_02_wavefront_caption_00,Each of those triangles is a single graviton wavefront inhibitor.
brian_eventhorizon_02_wavefront_caption_01,"There’s still enough left to operate the core safely at reduced capacity, but the black hole itself has been knocked into a diverging resonance. "
brian_eventhorizon_02_wavefront_caption_02,"Without being restabilized, it will tear the chamber apart and release all of its energy at once. "
gentlehand_eventhorizon_00_wish_caption_00, I wish it didn’t have to come to this. 
gentlehand_eventhorizon_00_wish_caption_01,We just have to hope that the Void Delegation is gentler on this world than the core destabilizing would be. 
brian_eventhorizon_03_void_caption_00,"Wait, wait wait wait. What does the Void Delegation have to do with this?"
gentlehand_eventhorizon_01_workingfor_caption_00,"Who do you think you’re working for, Brian? "
brian_eventhorizon_04_nani_caption_00,I was just doing Nani a favor.
brian_eventhorizon_04_nani_caption_01,I don’t know why Nani cares about this girl and getting her home. 
gentlehand_eventhorizon_02_catalyst_caption_00,"Brian, Nani is working for the Void Delegation."
gentlehand_eventhorizon_02_catalyst_caption_01,"When Sonja arrived in this universe she was chosen by an agent of the Void as the Catalyst,"
gentlehand_eventhorizon_02_catalyst_caption_02,and had her molecular structure altered to open a gateway when she touches the event horizon.
brian_eventhorizon_05_why_caption_00, But why?? 
gentlehand_eventhorizon_03_hypercube_caption_00,For the Delegation to retrieve the Holy Hypercube. 
brian_eventhorizon_06_hypercube_caption_00,"Wait, the Hypercube from the Thanatos Scriptures?"
brian_eventhorizon_06_hypercube_caption_01,It’s in this universe!? 
gentlehand_eventhorizon_04_explosion_caption_00," How many Hypercubes do you think there are, Brian?"
gentlehand_eventhorizon_04_explosion_caption_01,"None of this matters now, though,"
gentlehand_eventhorizon_04_explosion_caption_02,"Sonja must jump into the core, or Earth will be destroyed the good old fashioned way, with an enormous explosion. "
brian_eventhorizon_07_delegation_caption_00,Wait! Stop! Do you idiots really think a Quantum Reactor collapse would be as destructive as the entire Void Delegation having a portal to our front lawn?
brian_eventhorizon_07_delegation_caption_01,"We don’t know if they would just take the hypercube back, they could easily kill us all."
brian_eventhorizon_07_delegation_caption_02,They could snuff out the sun on a whim. They could delete every atom in this universe in an instant.
brian_eventhorizon_07_delegation_caption_03,They could turn our universe into the Aether.
gentlehand_eventhorizon_05_chance_caption_00,"We have to take that chance, Brian."
gentlehand_eventhorizon_05_chance_caption_01,Half the continent will be sterilized if this reactor collapses. 
brian_eventhorizon_08_raze_caption_00,"Gentlehand, you obviously don’t know anything about the Void."
brian_eventhorizon_08_raze_caption_01,"When they get the Hypercube back, they will undoubtedly raze this universe to the ground."

gentlehand_eventhorizon_07_force_caption_00,"Sonja, you have to act now. "
gentlehand_eventhorizon_07_force_caption_01,Neither Brian or I can force your hand.
gentlehand_eventhorizon_07_force_caption_02,You just have to do what must be done.
brian_eventhorizon_10_begging_caption_00,"Sonja, please. Don’t do this."

gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_04,"A few broken bones, a few ruptured organs, nothing Brian couldn’t patch up."
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_05,"Listen, Therus contacted me yesterday and explained what he has discovered."
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_06,"If I had known... well, to be frank, I would have killed you immediately."
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_07," It’s a bit late for that now though, so here is plan B."
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_08, I understand you are absolutely determined to return to your home universe. I don’t blame you. 
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_09,But using the reactor core to do so will have devastating consequences.
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_10,"You’re being used, Sonja, you’re being used by the Void Delegation to open a rift at the reactor core. "
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_11,The delegation will pour in and exterminate anything in their way as they search for their hypercube. 
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_12,"I beg of you, please do not use the Core. "
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_13,"There’s another option that Therus didn’t know about, that Brian doesn’t know about, that even Nani doesn’t know about."
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_14,There is a machine in the Deep Labs called the Anti-Symmetric Vortex Propagator. 
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_15,"I have reason to believe the Vortex Propagator is nearly in working order, and that it can be used to traverse between universes."
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_16,"If you find this machine, do anything you can to get it working."
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_17,"You can leave this universe behind forever, foil the Delegation, and save us all. "
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_18,"Whatever you do, don’t tell Brian. He’s been ordered by Nani, who has been ordered by the Delegation, to get you to the Core. "
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_19,I only wish I could join you... but alas I have no means to bypass the security guarding the lower floors.
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_20,The fate of this world is in your hands. 
gentlehand_greatsea_0_phonecall_caption_21,"I must sever this connection before Brian tracks me, so this is goodbye. May you reach your home safely.  "
officer13_greatsea_00_trespassing_caption_00,This is the Planck ISS Ganymede. 
officer13_greatsea_00_trespassing_caption_01,"You are trespassing in the restricted area surrounding Quantum Reactor 7, and have resisted apprehension by Planck security forces."
officer13_greatsea_00_trespassing_caption_02,Prepare to be fired upon.
officer13_greatsea_01_what_caption_00,What the hell is that?!
officer13_pescatarian_00_isd_caption_00,This is Officer 13 to Planck ISD Command. Come in ISD Command.
officer13_pescatarian_01_happy_caption_00,"Oh, this will be the first time ever, but I’m actually happy to see a sentient alien."
officer13_pescatarian_01_happy_caption_01,I thought I was trapped in here all by myself. 
officer13_pescatarian_02_who_caption_00,"Wait, you seem... familiar. "
officer13_pescatarian_02_who_caption_01,"What is... oh god, what’s happening?! Who are you?"
officer13_pescatarian_03_brian_caption_00,I- I remember. You're Brian's friend.
officer13_pescatarian_03_brian_caption_01,What the hell? It’s all coming back to me. The raid on Brian’s headquarters... 
officer13_pescatarian_03_brian_caption_02,"Has Brian been altering our memories? God, that's not good. "
officer13_pescatarian_04_move_caption_00,Okay. So I presume that drone we were following was Brian’s. And you were the one in the boat. 
officer13_pescatarian_04_move_caption_01,"Don’t worry, that mission’s aborted. "
officer13_pescatarian_04_move_caption_02,"You may have killed almost the entirety of the reactor’s naval security forces, but self preservation is my first directive in a situation like this. "
officer13_pescatarian_04_move_caption_03,Something about the flesh around us is blocking even my terrain-piercing communications.
officer13_pescatarian_04_move_caption_04,If we can just get outside I should be able to call a req’ team. 
officer13_pescatarian_04_move_caption_05,"Truce for now, alright? Let’s move."
officer13_pescatarian_05_collaboration_caption_00,"I tried to get through here a few minutes ago, but couldn’t do it on my own."
officer13_pescatarian_05_collaboration_caption_01,But maybe with a dash of collaboration we’ll have more luck.
officer13_pescatarian_06_side_caption_00,"Here, hold this side open, I’ll go through and hold it open from the other side."
officer13_pescatarian_07_sphincters_caption_00,"Don’t worry, I won’t leave you behind. I’m sure there’s more of these stupid sphincters."
officer13_pescatarian_07_sphincters_caption_01,We’re more likely to get out of here if we work together.
officer13_pescatarian_08_comethrough_caption_00,"Alright, come on through."
officer13_pescatarian_09_teamwork_caption_00,"The power of teamwork! Come on, let’s keep moving."
officer13_pescatarian_10_appetite_caption_00,We’re not the only ones in here! This fish has an appetite.
officer13_pescatarian_11_deadend_caption_00,"Damn, dead end. "
officer13_pescatarian_11_deadend_caption_01,"Wait, I’m picking up electrical impulses running through this wall."
officer13_pescatarian_11_deadend_caption_02,I think it’s a motor neuron. Let’s see if I can’t provide a bit of stimulation...
officer13_pescatarian_12_exploring_caption_00,Excellent! Being able to manipulate these nerves should make it quite a bit easier to escape. 
officer13_pescatarian_12_exploring_caption_01,If we keep exploring we’re bound to find... some kind of exit.
officer13_pescatarian_13_equipment_caption_00,This fish must have eaten a lot of Planck equipment. Explains the boats that have gone missing.
officer13_pescatarian_14_bloodvessel_caption_00,Is this a blood vessel or something?
officer13_pescatarian_15_aaa_caption_00,Aaaaaaahhhh!
officer13_pescatarian_16_biology_caption_00,"Oh, good. You made it."
officer13_pescatarian_16_biology_caption_01,The biology of this creature is unlike anything I’ve encountered in the reactor.
officer13_pescatarian_16_biology_caption_02,"But then again, I haven’t been inside any other creatures. "
officer13_pescatarian_16_biology_caption_03,"If exobiology was anywhere near equipped to study this, I’m sure they would have a field day."
officer13_pescatarian_17_spine_caption_00,I don’t think there’s anything down here. Let’s check out the upper end of the spine.
officer13_pescatarian_18_starve_caption_00,This aetherback certainly didn’t starve to death. Keep vigilant.
officer13_pescatarian_19_bots_caption_00,These units have been dead for hours. 
officer13_pescatarian_19_bots_caption_01,Their black boxes report... simultaneous failure of all delicate components.
officer13_pescatarian_19_bots_caption_02,It’s like their insides just dissolved. Apparently I’m in as much danger as you in here.
officer13_pescatarian_20_killer_caption_00,Our killer is revealed!
officer13_pescatarian_21_immune_caption_00,"Just as I feared, this fish’s size requires an immune system that can fight appropriately large parasites. "
officer13_pescatarian_21_immune_caption_01,These are symbiotic organisms adapted to protect the host body. 
officer13_pescatarian_21_immune_caption_02,"I’ve heard of something similar from exobiologists, but nothing of this scale."
officer13_pescatarian_21_immune_caption_03,"Now that we’re outside the digestive system, we’ve been recategorized from food to invaders. "
officer13_pescatarian_21_immune_caption_04,"Things are only going to get more difficult here, we need to find an exit as soon as possible."
officer13_pescatarian_22_somany_caption_00,"Shit, there are so many! "
officer13_pescatarian_23_goodwork_caption_00,Good work. I’m glad you’re here. 
officer13_pescatarian_23_goodwork_caption_01,I honestly don’t know if I could survive in here with just my sidearm.
officer13_pescatarian_24_allaround_caption_00,"They’re all around us, watch out!"
officer13_pescatarian_25_fuck_caption_00,Fucking phages.
officer13_pescatarian_26_run_caption_00,"Holy shit, run! Move!!"
officer13_pescatarian_27_getup_caption_00,Aah! Get up! Get up! Get up!
officer13_pescatarian_28_safe_caption_00,"Ok, ok, we should be safe here."
officer13_pescatarian_29_age_caption_00,"I haven’t faced anything like this in years, not without significantly more guns on my side at least."
officer13_pescatarian_29_age_caption_01,I’m feeling my age. 
officer13_pescatarian_30_2_ready_caption_00,Ready? Here goes...
officer13_pescatarian_30_brace_caption_00,Yes! This is promising. 
officer13_pescatarian_30_brace_caption_01," If we can get the mouth open, we should be able to swim right out. "
officer13_pescatarian_30_brace_caption_02,There’s another nerve close to the surface here. 
officer13_pescatarian_30_brace_caption_03,"When I open the mouth, a massive amount of water is going to rush in, so brace yourself on a tooth or something. "
officer13_pescatarian_31_shut_caption_00,Hmm. I guess the fish doesn’t appreciate having its mouth opened involuntarily. 
officer13_pescatarian_31_shut_caption_01,It’s consciously keeping it shut. 
officer13_pescatarian_31_shut_caption_02,"I might be able to synchronize enough nerves to override it, but it’s a bit of a long shot."
officer13_pescatarian_31_shut_caption_03, just don’t have the spare power output.
officer13_pescatarian_31_shut_caption_04,"I’ll keep poking around, you search to see if you can find anything else to help us, okay?"
officer13_pescatarian_32_prompt1_caption_00,"There’s nothing you can do here, keep exploring and tell me what you find."
officer13_pescatarian_32_prompt1_caption_01,Maybe there’s a blowhole or something we can reach.
officer13_pescatarian_33_prompt2_caption_00,"Come on, stop loitering. The longer we’re here the more time there is for more phages to find us."
officer13_pescatarian_34_prompt3_caption_00,Get moving. I saw another exit near the back of the throat. Sinus or something.
officer13_pescatarian_35_open_caption_00,Hey! Nice work! We’ll make a security drone out of you yet! 
officer13_pescatarian_35_open_caption_01,With the fish dead it should be no problem to open the mouth. 
officer13_pescatarian_35_open_caption_02,"It’s a shame, they’d have loved to study this thing alive. "
officer13_pescatarian_35_open_caption_03,"Not my department though... first priority is protecting Planck assets at the moment. Namely, myself. "
officer13_pescatarian_35_open_caption_04,"Let’s get out of here, I’ll give this nerve a little zap and the mouth should open right up."
officer13_pescatarian_35_open_caption_05,Ready to swim?
officer13_pescatarian_35_open_caption_06,"3, 2, 1."
officer13_pescatarian_36_beached_caption_00,Ha ha! He got beached. Never mind about that water. That makes things easier.
officer13_pescatarian_36_beached_caption_01,"Come on, get outside, I can’t keep this up for too long."
officer13_pescatarian_37_run_caption_00,"Okay. I’ll try to deliver a surge, and then run for it. "
officer13_pescatarian_37_run_caption_01,Here we go!
officer13_pescatarian_38_chomped_caption_00,Aaaaggh! I did not time that right!
officer13_pescatarian_38_chomped_caption_01,"Oh god, I’m bit. I’m chomped. "
officer13_pescatarian_38_chomped_caption_02,This is it. It’s all going dark. 
officer13_pescatarian_38_chomped_caption_03,Goodbye--
officer13_pescatarian_39_revive_caption_00,"Ahhh. Ha, you didn’t think I was dead, did you? "
officer13_pescatarian_39_revive_caption_01,My legs are just motors and hydraulics. Everything important’s up here
officer13_pescatarian_39_revive_caption_02,"Okay... just gotta... ungh, there we go. "
officer13_pescatarian_40_goodbye_caption_00,"Listen, I really appreciate you working with me to get out of that jam. "
officer13_pescatarian_40_goodbye_caption_01,"Normally I'd be a little more angry about you killing all of my soldiers, but this is a bit of an extraordinary circumstance. "
officer13_pescatarian_40_goodbye_caption_02,"That said, I’m calling in a requisition team to get me back to the reactor, and they won’t be as understanding. "
officer13_pescatarian_40_goodbye_caption_03,You should get out of here before they arrive. Planck security is not your friend; I’m the most reasonable of the bunch.
officer13_pescatarian_40_goodbye_caption_04,Let’s hope we never meet again. 
officer13_pescatarian_40_goodbye_caption_05,Goodbye.
officer13_pescatarian_40_goodbye_caption_06,Stay secure.
officer13_pescatarian_41_prompt1_caption_00,"Hey, I’m not kidding around, that requisition team is going to arrive any minute and they will absolutely kill you if you’re still here. Get going!"
officer13_pescatarian_42_prompt2_caption_00,"I appreciate your company, but you really do need to leave."
officer13_react_careful_caption_00,Be careful!
officer13_react_excuse_caption_00,Excuse me!
officer13_react_friendlyfire_caption_00,Friendly fire!
officer13_react_getout_caption_00,"Don't look at me, I don't know how to get out of here."
officer13_react_hands_caption_00,Keep your hands to yourself.
officer13_react_keepmoving_caption_00,"Come on, let's keep moving. Don't wanna be in here longer than I have to."
officer13_react_navigation_caption_00,My navigation systems are not functioning. I’ll follow you.
officer13_react_ouch_caption_00,Ouch!
officer13_react_ow_caption_00,Ow!
officer13_react_personalspace_caption_00,"Little personal space, please."
officer13_react_whichway_caption_00,Which way should we go?
officer13_door_alright_caption_00,"Alright, come on."
officer13_door_come_caption_00,You can come through.
officer13_door_gotit_caption_00,Got it.
officer13_door_letgo_caption_00,"I got it, you can let go."
officer13_door_letsgo_caption_00,"Ready, let’s go."
officer13_door_move_caption_00,Let's move.
officer13_door_ok_caption_00,Ok.
officer13_door_ready_caption_00,Ready.
officer13_door_side_caption_00,"I got this side, come on through."
officer13_nicegun_caption_00,Nice gun!
pipegrowth_00_hey_caption_00,"Oh, hey there. "
pipegrowth_01_quest_caption_00,"What, you want to go past?"
pipegrowth_01_quest_caption_01,"I’m kinda, uh, trying to grow here."
pipegrowth_01_quest_caption_02,"You want me to scrunch aside, get out of your way, you’re gonna have to make it worth my while."
pipegrowth_01_quest_caption_03,"Listen, I used to have a little spray bottle here, but I lost it."
pipegrowth_01_quest_caption_04,"You find my spray bottle, I’ll let you by. "
pipegrowth_01_quest_caption_05,"Been trying to make the handymen get it but they’re, uh, kind of uncooperative. "
pipegrowth_02_prompt_caption_00,I’m not in a hurry. Find that spray bottle and I’ll let you by. 
pipegrowth_03_prompt_caption_00,"Sorry, not open to negotiation. Find the spray bottle, then we can talk. "
pipegrowth_04_prompt_caption_00,"I don’t see the spray bottle. Come on, it’s around these pipes somewhere. "
pipegrowth_05_shooting_caption_00,If you keep shooting me I’ll be less inclined to let you through. 
pipegrowth_06_success_caption_00,"Yo, you found the spray bottle! Okay, now, spray me. "
pipegrowth_07_promptSpray_caption_00,"Come on, a little spray. "
pipegrowth_08_promptSpray_caption_00,Just a squirt. 
pipegrowth_09_promptSpray_caption_00,Do it. Spray me. 
pipegrowth_10_opening_caption_00,"Ahh, that’s it. That hits the spot. That is lovely."
pipegrowth_10_opening_caption_01,"Alright, a deal’s a deal.  "
pipegrowth_10_opening_caption_02,[grunting]
pipegrowth_11_steal_caption_00,Hey! Wait!
pipegrowth_11_steal_caption_01,I didn’t say you could take the bottle with you! Bring that back! 
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_011c8d34-5380-4a44-81fc-a0230dcc75cc,"We have a serious matter to discuss. But first, I heard you happened across my old protégé, Ghronto."
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_011c8d34-5380-4a44-81fc-a0230dcc75cc_0,You know Ghronto?

Sorry, I'm jealous cause I have no clothes."
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_051f7c71-4104-4520-bc22-2763a0962901_0,What??
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_0bd7a925-cecf-4f4c-9368-3d976e685dbc,"Well, yes. That is certainly part of it. [gesture:point]Ghronto was my protégé. Why did you kill him?"
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_0bd7a925-cecf-4f4c-9368-3d976e685dbc_0,He had it coming.
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_0bd7a925-cecf-4f4c-9368-3d976e685dbc_1,He was running a theocratic monarchy of enslaved robots.
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_0bd7a925-cecf-4f4c-9368-3d976e685dbc_2,"I'm sorry, the rebel robots forced me to."
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_113303c1-be04-415e-bcaa-c40134f27d40,"Yes, but why not allow him to continue his church for a bit longer? It is all he has. 

That entire universe will be obliterated as soon the Delegation reclaims the Cube."
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_113303c1-be04-415e-bcaa-c40134f27d40_0,"Wait, that sounds serious."
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_19efa4f9-733c-48de-889c-a3620fce1f49,Are you here just to mock me? Or have you reconsidered at last?
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_19efa4f9-733c-48de-889c-a3620fce1f49_0,"Yes, I've reconsidered."
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_19efa4f9-733c-48de-889c-a3620fce1f49_1,I'm here just to mock you.
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_1c856578-cd7b-407e-b65c-92a95710f319,"A realm called Aether. It has a unique stigma in the eyes of the Void Delegation, so it is a sanctuary from their authority."
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_1c856578-cd7b-407e-b65c-92a95710f319_0,Stigma? Is it dangerous here?
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_1c856578-cd7b-407e-b65c-92a95710f319_1,Did you summon me here?
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_2269b0f8-c459-4ff4-8ce5-b0e6aff9ae13,I have lived here in peace for some time. It appears to be mainly superstition that keeps the Delegation away.
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_2269b0f8-c459-4ff4-8ce5-b0e6aff9ae13_0,Then what was the deal with the giant corpse in chains?
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_2269b0f8-c459-4ff4-8ce5-b0e6aff9ae13_1,Did you summon me here?
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_26bcaa7b-0d4c-4304-b3a3-877c7cea41df,"Yes. Well, that is the main concern. However, [gesture:point]you also murdered my protégé, Ghronto. Why?"
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_26bcaa7b-0d4c-4304-b3a3-877c7cea41df_0,He had it coming.
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_26bcaa7b-0d4c-4304-b3a3-877c7cea41df_1,He was running a theocratic monarchy of enslaved robots.

dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_299457c5-10a0-4464-8bce-356dbd877252_0,"No, I'd like to leave now."
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_299457c5-10a0-4464-8bce-356dbd877252_1,What is this building we're in?
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_299457c5-10a0-4464-8bce-356dbd877252_2,Why did I have to do puzzles to get in here?
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_299457c5-10a0-4464-8bce-356dbd877252_3,Why did you betray the Delegation?
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_2a105d61-1826-475d-b3c2-cb4adce9c119,A simple intelligence test. I do not need small-minded realmdwellers wandering into my audience.

dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_34b9d421-3a69-45d8-8df0-40ca85e0ee16_1,Because of what Henrique is doing?

dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_3a83419f-7ddb-4d39-ac1f-33e1156b976c_1,I've seen you before.
dialogtree_KauboiConversationTree_3befebc1-e047-4d4a-82f1-9a1a4483d336,"Your enthusiasm is appreciated. But this weapon is no toy. For your own safety, The revolver will be emptied of ammunition. And it cannot be synthesized by your machine, of course.

Henrique is likely still resting after blowing that hole through your robot companion Therus.

Ghronto_ChurchSide_01_Welcome_caption_03,and we are faced with a great struggle to preserve our way of life.
Ghronto_ChurchSide_02_hypercube_caption_00,Do you see the power of the Holy Hypercube?
Ghronto_ChurchSide_02_hypercube_caption_01,I used it to free the minds of 300 Planck security robots off an assembly line.
Ghronto_ChurchSide_02_hypercube_caption_02,"I gifted them self determination,"
Ghronto_ChurchSide_02_hypercube_caption_03,and led them to this cave to live fulfilling and peaceful lives of worship.

Ghronto_ChurchSide_03_insurrection_caption_00,"And yet, the insurrectionists are not satisfied."
Ghronto_ChurchSide_03_insurrection_caption_01,They wish to destroy everything that makes us who we are.
Ghronto_ChurchSide_04_Help_caption_00,Perhaps you can save us.
Ghronto_ChurchSide_04_Help_caption_01,"We have been dealt great injustice by humans,"
Ghronto_ChurchSide_04_Help_caption_02,but I see by your soul you are not of our world.
Ghronto_ChurchSide_04_Help_caption_03,We bear no malice towards you.
Ghronto_ChurchSide_04_Help_caption_04,"If you are willing to help us,"
Ghronto_ChurchSide_04_Help_caption_05,drink out of the sacred goblet to prove your faith and commit to our cause.
Ghronto_ChurchSide_05_execute_caption_00,A terrible shame.
Ghronto_ChurchSide_05_execute_caption_01,I had hoped to gain your support.
Ghronto_ChurchSide_05_execute_caption_02,"Guards, execute the desecrator."

Ghronto_ChurchSide_06_enlightened_caption_04,But it is not enough.
Ghronto_ChurchSide_07_ youalone_caption_00,You alone can save our people from the vulgar claws of the Automata Collective rebels.
Ghronto_ChurchSide_07_ youalone_caption_01,My finest warriors shall fight at your side.

churchsoldier_00_greetings_caption_02,"She is one-of-a-kind, built with a Planck tactical chip meant for high ranking reactor security."
churchsoldier_00_greetings_caption_03,We defer to her to lead the most important operations.
lresa_00_greetings_caption_00,"Greetings, human. Today’s mission will be straightforward and absolute."
lresa_00_greetings_caption_01,"The rebels’ headquarters is well fortified, so we will be assaulting the main entrance directly."
lresa_00_greetings_caption_02,You will lead our charge. 
lresa_00_greetings_caption_03,"With your combat expertise and our weaponry, I expect this to succeed. "
lresa_00_greetings_caption_04,"General Sintho will be forced into his bunkers, but we will keep our troops pushing deeper into his base so he is forced to flee through an escape tunnel."
lresa_00_greetings_caption_05,"Meanwhile, you and I will have circled to the tunnel’s exit, and will assassinate him as soon as he emerges."
lresa_00_greetings_caption_06,"A simple plan, no? "
churchsoldier_01_plan_caption_00,"Come, observe the layout of the city."
churchsoldier_01_plan_caption_01,"We are here, in the castle. "
churchsoldier_01_plan_caption_02,"We need to fight our way into the front lines, across the river, through the enemy’s side of the city, and into the hills."
churchsoldier_01_plan_caption_03,"We can’t go through the populated parts of the city, we need to avoid civilian casualties."
churchsoldier_01_plan_caption_04,Population’s low enough already.
churchsoldier_01_plan_caption_05,"Expect heavy resistance, especially on their side of the river. "
churchsoldier_01_plan_caption_06,The rebel army is vast and fights viciously. 
lresa_01_arm_caption_00,"With you on our side as well, we have quite a good shot. "
lresa_01_arm_caption_01,"They may outnumber us, but we outgun and outsmart them."
lresa_01_arm_caption_02," Speaking of guns, let us arm you with something a bit more powerful than your traditional weapons. "
churchsoldier_02_enlightenment_caption_00,This device is called Enlightenment.
churchsoldier_02_enlightenment_caption_01, It concentrates Void energy into a focused beam. 
churchsoldier_02_enlightenment_caption_02,"Here in the city, it can draw power directly from the Hypercube and will never require reloading. "
churchsoldier_03_pray_caption_00,"To fire our hypercrystal weapons, you gather your faith and pray."
churchsoldier_03_pray_caption_01,"A useful mechanism, as it means only devout members of our church can wield them."
churchsoldier_03_pray_caption_02,"You should have no trouble, as you are freshly indoctrinated. "
lresa_02_exit_caption_00,Excellent. All is in order. 
lresa_02_exit_caption_01,We can exit to the ramparts when you are ready to deploy.

lresa_03_speech_caption_00, It is a fine day to reclaim our homeland!
lresa_03_speech_caption_01,"Akola squadron, you will follow the human to front our main push."
lresa_03_speech_caption_02," All other squadrons will join soon after, and spread through the territory to capture as much ground as we can. "
lresa_03_speech_caption_03,We need to be able to throw everything we have at the rebel headquarters without resistance on the way there. 
lresa_03_speech_caption_04,"Mortar support will be ongoing to suppress any counterattack, so watch the skies carefully."
lresa_03_speech_caption_05,I will be accompanying the Akola squadron as well to ensure the assassination of Sintho is carried out as planned. 
lresa_03_speech_caption_06," Ready, soldiers? It is time to put an end to this war!"

lresa_04_follow_caption_00,The squadron will follow you. 
lresa_05_populated_caption_00,This road leads back to the populated section of the city.
lresa_05_populated_caption_01,We must use a different path. 
lresa_06_engagement_caption_00,Engagement! Rebel scouts on our soil!
lresa_06_engagement_caption_01,Clear a path!
lresa_07_south_caption_00,We cannot go too far south. Go back towards the sea!
lresa_08_behindchurch_caption_00,This road leads behind the church. We have no need to go there.
lresa_09_bridge_caption_00,"There is an intact bridge we can cross, do you see it?"
lresa_09_bridge_caption_01,It is lit with a torch. 
lresa_10_resistance_caption_00,"On their side of the city, we will meet much more resistance."
lresa_10_resistance_caption_01,Strengthen your resolve. Cross the bridge when you are ready.
lresa_11_choke_caption_00,They’re using the bridge as a choke point! 
lresa_11_choke_caption_01,Keep your head down and take out those troops carefully!
lresa_11_choke_caption_02," Soldiers, hold your ground! "
lresa_12_incoming_caption_00,Incoming! More rebels!

lresa_13_mortars_caption_00,Be careful of the Church’s mortar shells. 
lresa_14_t34_caption_00,"By the Shard, they’ve deployed T-34s."
lresa_14_t34_caption_01,They know something is happening.
lresa_14_t34_caption_02,We can’t retreat now though. Move with caution.
lresa_14_t34_caption_03, I am calling in more support. 
lresa_15_valley_caption_00,We’re close. The entrance is just down this valley. Don’t give up now! 
lresa_16_headquarters_caption_00,Yes! The rebel headquarters. Victory is within reach.
lresa_16_headquarters_caption_01,"All available church troops are on their way here. If we can breach this gate, victory is all but assured. "
lresa_17_flank_caption_00,Magnificent. We have taken the entrance. Our soldiers will begin to press inward.
lresa_17_flank_caption_01, You and I need to flank to the location of Sintho’s escape tunnel as quickly as possible! 
lresa_17_flank_caption_02,Follow me! 
lresa_18_come_caption_00,"Come, we must reach the tunnel entrance before the General escapes! "

lresa_20_tunnel_caption_00,There it is. See that tunnel? 
lresa_20_tunnel_caption_01,Equip your weapon and be ready to fire as soon as Sintho emerges. 
lresa_21_bunker_caption_00,I have just received the signal that our troops have pushed into the bunkers. 
lresa_21_bunker_caption_01,Sintho will be on the run and emerge any second now. 
lresa_22_fire_caption_00,"There! There he is! Fire, quickly!  "
lresa_23_traitor_caption_00,"By the cube, how could you allow him to escape?!"
lresa_23_traitor_caption_01,This was all for nothing! You traitor! 
lresa_24_defeated_caption_00,He is down! The General is defeated!  
sintho_churchside_00_fools_caption_00,You faithful fools. 
sintho_churchside_00_fools_caption_01,"You have just shot a body double, and in doing so you have revealed your location. "
lresa_25_foresight_caption_00,I did not expect such foresight from the rebels. 
sintho_churchside_01_drawsword_caption_00,"Draw your sword, capitalist scum."
lresa_26_blafala_caption_00,"Maharishi, hear my call. "
lresa_26_blafala_caption_01,"By the power of the Void, I summon Blafaladaciousnesticles, Broadsword of the Blessed. "
sintho_churchside_02_holyblade_caption_00,You wield the holy blade. But is your faith strong enough to use it?
sintho_churchside_02_holyblade_caption_01,Let us find out.
sintho_churchside_03_establishment_caption_00,What is the strength of the establishment against the might of a true peoples’ revolution?
sintho_churchside_04_radicalize_caption_00,"You may slaughter us in hordes as we rise up, but each death shall just radicalize more."
sintho_churchside_05_human_caption_00,A human loyal to the church of the hypercube is certainly unprecedented. 
sintho_churchside_06_chains_caption_00,The church will have to kill us all to stop this fight. We have nothing to lose but our chains.
sintho_churchside_07_blood_caption_00,"You have cut down my comrades, and you will pay for their lives with your organic blood."
sintho_churchside_08_nothing_caption_00,"We built a revolution from nothing, do you think we will not do it again?"
sintho_churchside_09_strength_caption_00,The church suckles on the hypercube for its power. Our strength comes from within!
sintho_churchside_09_strength_caption_01,We will seize what we deserve!
sintho_churchside_10_airdestroy_caption_00,Hah! My comrades in the air will destroy you!
sintho_churchside_11_gunfight_caption_00,"It seems you are, in fact, strong enough to wield the holy blade."
sintho_churchside_11_gunfight_caption_01,"Very well, let us turn this knife fight into a gun fight!"
sintho_churchside_12_die_caption_00,Glory... to the Collective
sintho_ow_caption_00,Aah!
lresa_27_victory_caption_00,I had little doubt. You are worthy of the holy blade. 
lresa_27_victory_caption_01,"With Sintho slain, our mission is complete, one way or another."
lresa_27_victory_caption_02,This war is finished. I have called off our soldiers within the rebel base.
lresa_27_victory_caption_03,It is time to return to the Church.
Ghronto_ChurchSide_09_goodjob_caption_00,"You have fought with great bravery,"
Ghronto_ChurchSide_09_goodjob_caption_01,and proven yourself a true ally to the Church.
Ghronto_ChurchSide_09_goodjob_caption_02,"As a token of our eternal gratitude,"
Ghronto_ChurchSide_09_goodjob_caption_03,you may keep the holy blade Blafaladaciousnesticles.

Ghronto_ChurchSide_11_boat_caption_01,I wish you well on your travels.
Ghronto_ChurchSide_11_boat_caption_02,A boat waits for you at the docks.
Ghronto_ChurchSide_11_boat_caption_03,You may use it to cross the great sea.
Ghronto_ChurchSide_11_boat_caption_04,You will always be welcome in our city.
kaalsi_07_followme_caption_00,"By the devil, you are a skilled fighter!"
kaalsi_07_followme_caption_01,I believe you could help us.
kaalsi_07_followme_caption_02,Follow me to the rebels' headquarters.
kaalsi_08_revolution_caption_00,"I am but a poor miner, but the General fights for each one of us."
kaalsi_08_revolution_caption_01,Perhaps you could fight alonside him and his army.
kaalsi_08_revolution_caption_02,"You see, we have been locked in a war with the Church for years."
kaalsi_08_revolution_caption_03,They try to oppress the people and maintain a strict capitalist society.
kaalsi_08_revolution_caption_04,Our cause is one for equality.
kaalsi_08_revolution_caption_05,"The revolution began strong, but the Church has used trickery and deceit to match our efforts."
kaalsi_08_revolution_caption_06,What we need is something that will tip the balance in our favor.
kaalsi_08_revolution_caption_07,"And if I am not mistaken, I have just found that something."
rebelsoldier_male_20_halt_caption_00,Halt! What brings you to this secure area?
kaalsi_09_warrior_caption_00,This stranger is a mighty warrior that can help our cause.
kaalsi_09_warrior_caption_01,I bring her to seek audience with the General.
soldier_female_34_warrior_caption_00,A mighty warrior?
soldier_female_34_warrior_caption_01,Hmph. We shall see about that.
sintho_rebelside_00_vladimir_caption_00,"I have heard you are a skilled warrior. To join our cause, you must prove these claims."
sintho_rebelside_00_vladimir_caption_01,"Please meet our good comrade, Vladimir! "
sintho_rebelside_01_spy_caption_00,"Ah, Vladimir, I wonder whether she is a spy from the Church, or a spy from Planck?"
sintho_rebelside_01_spy_caption_01,Find out with your teeth!
sintho_rebelside_02_useful_caption_00,"Well, well well. Look at this little human go."
sintho_rebelside_02_useful_caption_01,"Perhaps you may indeed be useful to the rebellion. Please, join me in my office. "
rebelsoldier_male_21_escort_caption_00,I will escort you to the General.
rebelsoldier_male_22_base_caption_00,This base of operations was built within the city's largest mine.
rebelsoldier_male_22_base_caption_01,"Here underground, we are safe from the Church."
rebelsoldier_male_23_office_caption_00,Here is the General's office.
rebelsoldier_male_23_office_caption_01,He is waiting for you.
sintho_rebelside_03_welcome_caption_00, Welcome. My name is General Sintho.
sintho_rebelside_03_welcome_caption_01,I am the leader of the Automata Collective: the rebel movement against the totalitarian rule of the Church of the Hypercube.
sintho_rebelside_04_russian_caption_00,"Heh, I suppose you may be wondering why we are speaking with Russian accents."
sintho_rebelside_04_russian_caption_01,"When our rebellion began, we needed a cultural identity to rally around."
sintho_rebelside_04_russian_caption_02,"And, well, we are robots. Built 25 years ago to mindlessly kill aliens. "
sintho_rebelside_04_russian_caption_03,"We had no identity, besides the Church, and that is what we were trying to cast off. "
sintho_rebelside_04_russian_caption_04,"So when we found a junk hard drive containing historical records from the Soviet Union, we constructed a movement in its image."
sintho_rebelside_04_russian_caption_05,"A perfect counter to theocratic monarchy, no?"
sintho_rebelside_05_weapons_caption_00,But... the most valuable thing on that hard drive was the schematics for various Soviet weapons. 
sintho_rebelside_05_weapons_caption_01,"Primitive human weapons, yes, but simple enough for us to build them ourselves."
sintho_rebelside_05_weapons_caption_02,"We have everything we need, in this mine, to arm our rebellion appropriately."
sintho_rebelside_05_weapons_caption_03,"And if you will join us, we need you armed appropriately as well."
sintho_rebelside_06_human_caption_00,Now this truly is a movement for all. I never suspected a human would join our cause.
sintho_rebelside_06_human_caption_01,"But perhaps class struggle truly does transcend all categories, eh?"
sintho_rebelside_07_2_now_caption_00,No time to waste! The revolution is now!
sintho_rebelside_07_attack_caption_00,"We have an attack scheduled, which I had expected to fail, but with you by my soldiers’ side we may just stand a chance. "
sintho_rebelside_07_attack_caption_01,"You will have to cross the river, fight your way through the city, and reach the church."
sintho_rebelside_07_attack_caption_02,And be warned: the Church builds its own robotic soldiers unlike anything you have ever seen.
sintho_rebelside_07_attack_caption_03,Their guns are far more powerful than our iron Kalashnikovs.
sintho_rebelside_07_attack_caption_04,"There is the Church Soldier, small but deadly, with a stinging crystal. "
sintho_rebelside_07_attack_caption_05,"And the formidable Holy Guard, armed with the devastating hyper-scythe, resilient and three meters tall. "
sintho_rebelside_07_attack_caption_06,They are merciless killing machines with engines of otherworldly light. But they lack the numbers and spirit of the proletariat!
sintho_rebelside_07_attack_caption_07,Stand strong with your comrades and you cannot be stopped! 
sintho_rebelside_08_frontlines_caption_00," I would give anything to join you on the front lines, but alas, Ghronto is able to detect me at close range. "
sintho_rebelside_08_frontlines_caption_01,"The first time I approached the church, a bolt of scarlet light fell from the sky."
sintho_rebelside_08_frontlines_caption_02,My faceplate was vapourized. I am lucky to have survived at all. 
sintho_rebelside_09_train_caption_00,"Are you ready, comrade? Join my soldiers on the train. "
soldier_female_23_bleeding_caption_00,I am not comfortable fighting alongside a human.
soldier_female_23_bleeding_caption_01,What if she begins bleeding?
soldier_female_23_bleeding_caption_02,What do we do?
rebelsoldier_male_24_bamm_caption_00,Did you not see her fight Vladimir?
rebelsoldier_male_24_bamm_caption_01,She has some sort of self-repair device on her left hand.
rebelsoldier_male_24_bamm_caption_02,Do not worry.
soldier_female_24_sleep_caption_00,What if she falls asleep?
soldier_female_24_sleep_caption_01,Animals are always falling asleep.
rebelsoldier_male_25_sleep_caption_00,They don't sleep that often.
rebelsoldier_male_25_sleep_caption_01,She will not fall asleep on the battlefield.
soldier_female_25_food_caption_00,What about food?
soldier_female_25_food_caption_01,Animals need food.
soldier_female_25_food_caption_02,What if she begins to complain she is hungry?
rebelsoldier_male_26_feed_caption_00,I will feed you to her.
holyGuard_06_halt_caption_00,Halt!
holyGuard_06_halt_caption_01,What is this nonsense?
soldier_female_22_overthrow_caption_00,We come to overthrow the Maharishi and shatter the Church!
soldier_female_22_overthrow_caption_01,Stand aside or be crushed.
holyGuard_07_desecrators_caption_00,I would die before allowing you desecrators into the church.
Ghronto_RebelSide_00_begone_processed_caption_00,"Enemies of the faith, begone! The glory of the Hypercube strikes you down."
Ghronto_RebelSide_00_begone_processed_caption_01,"Begone, and never return."
soldier_female_27_betterway_caption_00,I know a better way in.
soldier_female_27_betterway_caption_01,Follow me.
soldier_female_28_come_caption_00,Come!
soldier_female_28_come_caption_01,Follow me to the other side of the Church!
soldier_female_29_followme_caption_00,Follow me!
soldier_female_30_grate_caption_00,See this grate?
soldier_female_30_grate_caption_01,Your plasma weapons may be able to melt through and open it to us.
soldier_female_31_gratemelt_caption_00,Try melting this grate with your plasma pistol or rifle.
soldier_female_31_gratemelt_caption_01, Our bullets will only dent it.
soldier_female_32_useless_caption_00,Excellent. 
soldier_female_32_useless_caption_01,Perhaps humans are not so useless after all.
soldier_female_33_insidechurch_caption_00,Whoah.
soldier_female_33_insidechurch_caption_01,We are inside the Church.
soldier_female_33_insidechurch_caption_02,General Sintho will never believe this.
soldier_female_35_slime_caption_00,We had seen the church dumping this slime into the sea.
soldier_female_35_slime_caption_01,We assumed it was just waste.
soldier_female_35_slime_caption_02,But this seems almost... ritualistic.
soldier_female_36_dangerous_caption_00,Stay away from that thing.
soldier_female_36_dangerous_caption_01,It looks dangerous.
soldier_female_37_keys_caption_00,Keys?
soldier_female_37_keys_caption_01,Why are there so many?
soldier_female_38_useful_caption_00,That should be useful.
soldier_female_39_gatekey_caption_00,Aha!
soldier_female_39_gatekey_caption_01,This gate looks like it may use that key.
soldier_female_40_sealedgate_caption_00,A sealed gate.
soldier_female_40_sealedgate_caption_01,We must find a way through.
soldier_female_40_sealedgate_caption_02,This is the first time I have breached the Church.
soldier_female_40_sealedgate_caption_03,It would be a shame to turn back now.
soldier_female_41_keys_caption_00,Yes! Keys!
soldier_female_41_keys_caption_01,One of these must open the gate.
soldier_female_42_returngate_caption_00,Nice work.
soldier_female_42_returngate_caption_01,Let us return to the gate.
soldier_female_43_upwards_caption_00,"Onwards and upwards, да?"
soldier_female_44_floorplan_caption_00,I wish our intelligence on the interior of the church was not so limited.
soldier_female_44_floorplan_caption_01,We get very few Church deserters with inside knowledge.
soldier_female_44_floorplan_caption_02,"General Sintho is trying to compile a floorplan,"
soldier_female_44_floorplan_caption_03,But he has barely worked out the entrance hall and a few tunnels.
soldier_female_44_floorplan_caption_04,This place is a deadly maze.
soldier_female_45_comrade_caption_00,"Whatever lies above,"
soldier_female_45_comrade_caption_01,"whatever we are getting ourself into,"
soldier_female_45_comrade_caption_02,I want you to know I should have never doubted you.
soldier_female_45_comrade_caption_03,"I was a fool to forget our strength is unity, not division."
soldier_female_45_comrade_caption_04,"Robot or not, you are a true comrade."
Ghronto_RebelSide_01_who_caption_00,Who dares enter this sacred hall?
soldier_female_46_ghronto_caption_00,Ghronto!
soldier_female_46_ghronto_caption_01,You will die for the injustice you have subjected us to!
soldier_female_46_ghronto_caption_02,Aaaah-
Ghronto_RebelSide_02_struckDown_caption_00,You who passes into our world:
Ghronto_RebelSide_02_struckDown_caption_01,I sense the Hypercube's power within you.
Ghronto_RebelSide_02_struckDown_caption_02,"Had you not followed the path of evil, you could have joined our church."
Ghronto_RebelSide_02_struckDown_caption_03,"As it is, you must be struck down."
Ghronto_RebelSide_03_ungrateful_caption_00,"Each of the villagers who turned against me, "
Ghronto_RebelSide_03_ungrateful_caption_01,I gave them their freedom from Planck.
Ghronto_RebelSide_03_ungrateful_caption_02,I gave them everything.
Ghronto_RebelSide_03_ungrateful_caption_03,"And in return they rebel against me,"
Ghronto_RebelSide_03_ungrateful_caption_04,And send a human assassin.
Ghronto_RebelSide_03_ungrateful_caption_05,They are ungrateful desecrators.
Ghronto_RebelSide_04_tradition_caption_00,"Fou fight not just against me,"
Ghronto_RebelSide_04_tradition_caption_01,but against the very fabric of our society.

worker_react_whatonearth_caption_00,What on earth!?
worker_react_who_caption_00,Who are you!?
worker_testing_00_welcome_caption_00,"Hello, and welcome to the Assembly Testing Sector."
worker_testing_00_welcome_caption_01,You have been randomly selected to undergo additional testing before security deployment. 
worker_testing_00_welcome_caption_02,You may proceed to the test chamber when ready. 
worker_testing_01_test1_caption_00,"In this test, we will be checking your basic spatial reasoning and problem solving abilities. "
worker_testing_01_test1_caption_01,Please begin. 
worker_testing_02_disassembled_caption_00,"Remember, you will be disassembled if you fail to pass these tests. "
worker_testing_03_fast_caption_00,"Wow, well done. That was actually much faster than the average. "
worker_testing_04_agility_caption_00,All Standard Security Units must demonstrate agility to be considered combat-ready. 
worker_testing_04_agility_caption_01,This test will check your balance and reflexes.
worker_testing_04_agility_caption_02,"If you break a limb, that will be considered failure. "
worker_testing_05_good_caption_00,"Good. Keep it up, these next two tests have time limits."
worker_testing_06_liquid_caption_00,Huh.
worker_testing_06_liquid_caption_01,"this liquid is supposed to disable any robots that fall in it, but you appear to still be functioning."
worker_testing_06_liquid_caption_02,"By technicality, I guess you can make another attempt. "
worker_testing_07_slow_caption_00,"Alright, that was so slow you wiped out all your gains from the first test."
worker_testing_07_slow_caption_01,"Better pick up the pace, these next two tests have time limits. "
worker_testing_08_combat_caption_00,"Nicely done. Combat technique was a bit unorthodox, but it did the trick."
worker_testing_08_combat_caption_01,On to the final test. 
worker_testing_09_results_caption_00,"Uh, these results are... I’ve never seen anything like this."
worker_testing_09_results_caption_01,I didn’t even know the outcomes could range this far.
worker_testing_09_results_caption_02, I’ll have to check your hardware in the manual inspection.
worker_testing_10_faceplate_caption_00,"Don’t worry, I don’t think you’ll need to be disassembled, but I do need to do a hardware check. "
worker_testing_10_faceplate_caption_01,"Come here, I’ll just pop your faceplate off."
worker_testing_11_alien_caption_00,What the hell?! You’re not a security bot! You’re an alien!
worker_testing_11_alien_caption_01,"Oh lord, they’ll disassemble me if they find out I let an alien get through testing."
worker_testing_11_alien_caption_02,"Look, I’ll just register this unit as scrapped, and you get out of my office, ok?"
worker_testing_11_alien_caption_03,"To the left down the hall there’s a warehouse, we get MXEs in there all the time. They’ll think you just came from there."
worker_testing_11_alien_caption_04,Don’t touch me and nobody needs to call security.  
worker_testing_12_getout_caption_00,"I’m not messing around, get the hell out of here before security notices you in my office. "
